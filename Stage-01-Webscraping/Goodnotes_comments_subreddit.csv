You can send a report here: https://reportaproblem.apple.com/store/360593530/select/fraudulent

Copy/Paste if you want: 

As of the new update to Notability (version 11.0), the developer has stated those who purchased the app before it was free will only have the functionality they paid for, for the next year, and will then be downgraded to the free version. This is against App Store guidelines section 3.1.2(a) which states that an app switching to a subscription model cannot remove features for those who have previously purchased the app.",/r/GoodNotes/comments/ql7tlu/hey_guys_just_wanted_to_announce_today_is_the_end/hj330z2/,fj-3

18,ioc1ei0,t3_ql7tlu,"I'd love to know if Goodnotes OR notability OR another app can do what I'm looking for..These are the note taking styles I want to accomplish on my iPad:

1. mindmapping/brain dumping style with the space available to keep growing as my thoughts/map grows
2. making summary notes from the physical text books I read
3. course pdf workbooks which already come with blank editable text boxes that I fill in with handwriting instead of typing
4. annotating pdf lecture notes, highlighting etc
5. When doing my research from reading physical books, can I take a photo of the page of value, highlight the key paragraph that was useful on the note taking app, and then make notes regarding this key paragraph in the app? Not necessarily 'annotating' that page beside the margins but using that paragraph as a springboard for idea generation and writing 'beside' the paragraph?  

6.   
\*\*Now the other key feature I want is if the app has a button that can **convert my WHOLE document of notes** into text which I can then easily export out as pdf or another editable document type so that I can refine my ideas with a keyboard on my computer subsequently (Eg I'm writing a book but the beginning ideas and development are all done by 'hand' and later quickly expanded upon by typing)I think that's it for now but would greatly appreciate learning if the above is possible.

202,giqit7c,t1_ginxnm5,"Hi so I figured it out

Basically I should have save them as a PDF instead of a jpeg as I guess jpeg does save the size properly

What appears to work is turn the saved jpeg file into a PDF. I did this two different ways

1. I pressed and held on the image of notebook in my file folder leading to an array of options popping up. The last option being create PDF.

Then I uploaded pdf copy to good notes, 

While this worked I did find I had white lines on the side of the notebook but the notebook was the same size as paper

Option 2 I did was I imported the jpeg image into procreate then re-saved as a PDF, this way I did not get the white lines when importing to goodnotes

I saw some people also recommended using pages to convert to PDF.


But if you still have the white lines come up on notebook and do not want, let me know which notebook covers you wanted to use and I can do it in procreate for you",/r/GoodNotes/comments/kqqa3p/i_tried_out_procreate_and_made_25_fun_notebook/giqit7c/,hippiesinthewind
