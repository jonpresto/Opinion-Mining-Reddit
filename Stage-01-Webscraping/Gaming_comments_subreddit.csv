65,etow0aj,t3_ccr8c8,"One of my most enduring video game memories is from the original EverQuest. I had started a new job doing tech support for dialup internet and had made acquaintances with a few of the gamers in the office. 

EQ was the first real MMO I had played, and everything was larger than life. I had no context for anything I was seeing. I had created a dwarf warrior I think it was and Dave from the office met up with me on his high level wizard. He brought me to North Ro, outside of Freeport.

We teleported to the spires there which was amazing and really captured the imagination. But what really stood out were the giant scarabs. I had no idea what they were except they were enormous compared to my dwarf. Dave--I wish I could remember his character name--casually blew them up in one shot and then even beat one to death with his staff.

I have a ton of other really great EQ memories, but that's the earliest and most dear. The sense of wonder and scale from that time has rarely been fully recaptured since then.

175,etp15ck,t3_ccr8c8,"Story time.

I was very good at halo going into uni. I was the best on campus, and no one else was very close for the first year or two I was there.  At the start, people would just come in and watch me play MLG matchmaking or customs with my other good friends.  Many of them wanted a shot, so we would play 2s-4s on matchmaking, and I would let them ruin my rank, so I could build it back up for them to ruin again.  Eventually, there was enough interest that we had 8 guys who wanted to play.  

We had enough interest, so we played LANs. We would set up two CRT tv's in different two rooms and connect them with an Ethernet cable through the hallway.  At the start we would have to scrap to get 8 people to play, pounding on doors and pulling guys from their girlfriends.  Sometimes we played 2v2s or 3v3s, but NEVER anything but true MLG rules.  

My team would literally never lose if I was playing full on, so I played lazy most of the time so it kept the games fairer.  I would give up snipes/shotty/rockets everytime to let everyone else practice.  I would even pretend to have homework, pass the controller, and coach one team while I ""wrote a paper.""  

These were my boys.  After a few months, my boys got very, very good.

By the end of our freshman year, we had 10-12 guys every night playing competitive games.  We would play in my dorm from after dinner til one or two am.  There was ALWAYS someone in my room, on my xbox, even if we weren't LANing.  We even had four upper classmen who were on sports teams (they lived in different dorms) challenge our best four.  Then I played full on. There were around ten guys watching these games, and I got a few killtacs.  One memorable killtac was on Ascension and it was a full chamber, four headshot sniper killtac.  The room exploded and kids ran from my room to the other room just to trashtalk in the middle of the game.  They lost around 10 in a row before they left without saying good game. The upper classmen wouldn't let me play against them anymore, but they loved having me over to carry them in BTB or whatever shit they played. 

Sophomore year started and a new batch of freshman came in.  This added six more guys.    An upperclassman transfer heard about us, so he joined.  He was as good as I was, so we were always team captains to keep games balanced (he might have been a bit better than I was, but I would never tell him that.  He was the pointguard for our school's basketball team and absurdly cocky at the time. We would later become roommates and he was in my wedding).  At this point, we had far too many people and we had to figure out ways to get everyone a chance.  Bottom two +/- players from each team passed the controller.  At around this time, I no longer had to play lazy, and some of my friends that were shit at the start were outperforming me.  It got to the point where we had 6-8 guys who were close to the same skill level.  We could make very competitive teams, and my Junior year, it had gotten very competitive.  We would have halo drama complete with fights and shit. That was good fun too, because then I could take the training wheels off and talk trash a bit too. 

We ended up sending a team of four to MLG Columbus in the early 00's.  We did not do great (shocker, I was a big fish in a little pond), but we played very respectably during scrims with other teams our level.

My dad got me into video games with the original DOOM and DOOM 2. I remember always calling him upstairs to help me find the exit or to beat a certain area/boss.

One day I called him up, but he looked confused. For the first time ever, I was further along in a game than he was. Soon after, *he* started calling **me** upstairs for advice, and I taught him the cheat codes to have more fun.

That was the beginning of the end of his gaming career, unfortunately. Work and family duties kept getting in the way, so not long after the PS2 he stopped playing video games with me and my brother. He'd always loved racing and beat-em-up games. He rocked racing but sucked at fighting, though when he spammed Law in Tekken he was unbeatable.

Fast forward 20+ years, and my mum decided to buy him an old Xbox360. He loves it and tries to play, but he missed out on so many advancements in video games that he just can't keep up. He still loves hearing me talk about them and showing them to him.

495,etow036,t3_ccr8c8,"I always enjoy teaching ppl how to play games. It's often the case in Roblox whenever there's a game that has a level-up system, it's almost explicitly required for higher lvl players to help lower lvl players. There's always the troller, of course, but whenever I join a game and theres high-tier players willing to help, it's such an enjoyable experience and then, once I meet them up in the big leagues, I join their ranks to help others. I've seen it mostly in the Infinity RPG game. Feels good the whole time.

Edit: Well, at times it's hard to teach when there's skill involved. Manual mechanics, like in Overwatch or ESO, may be harder to help translate for a new player. It's often like trying to teach someone a language you just learned in my opinion. 

Sometimes it's just *your* language or ""behavior"" that makes you good with the character you're using. You develop it to where it's no longer just you telling yourself what to do, but it eventually becomes instinct. Teaching a new player is basically ""dumbing it down"" again. I've seen it have repercussions on the teacher at times.

Eh, it's still worth it in the end, because then you've got someone who plays like you, so playing together becomes that much more fun and easy. Hopefully.

Next thing i know I'm showing half of them how the different mechanics behind some of the glitches work, how to casually fight some bosses out of a speedrun, ext. Soon my friend who brushed off dark souls now wanted to give it a go... cue the death montage for a while, but eventually he was getting the hang of it. Had to help him with a boss or two at first, but now I'm looking at his steam profile and he's got a solid 100+ hours on DS1 and he's planning on jumping into 2 and 3. We even got another friend or two into the meat grinder and now we all have fun chatting it up. As for me I've kinda given up speedrunning it.

My brother and my old friend have very similar taste in games, but I hate playing most of the games they love and I could never do it for long.

I still play a few games with them, we do have some similar tastes. It's mostly games where you can play in very different ways. I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming. It's usually shooters/fantasy rpg's, like Borderlands and Warframe  (*Always 3d, 2d does absolutely nothing for me. I have several 2d games I never played through and kinda regret buying.

But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables.",/r/gaming/comments/ccr8c8/take_your_time_you_got_this/etp01xk/,Ennbeard

And then you will have a turning complete CPU, just hook up some memory and a way to read the outputs and, you would have a programmable computer in minecraft, and if you exclude the add and subtract operations of the CPU it would theoretically be one of the more simple cups you could make, you could go super risc and have only a not and an and operation along with the non alu operations for the simplest computer in minecraft.",/r/gaming/comments/ccr8c8/take_your_time_you_got_this/etp8lmb/,bestjakeisbest

Get a zombie that can pick up items (they don‚Äôt de spawn when they hold something) put them in a glass tube (have dealings when working with zombies, helmets only last certain times) with flowing water so they are stuck in a corner. Have the corner block be removed (still stuck in but so a minecart can pick them up through the wall. Drop a villager in and wait for it to get turned. Have the minecart track that leaves from that corner and  have a fork in the track so you can send the zombie back into the tube and the other way sends them to the trading hall. From there cure them and place down a lectern (if you want enchants). Note sometimes a glitch hapenes where the librarian decides to untrade themselfs so ALWAYS have the stuff to buy the books (couple of emeralds and books) because once you buy from them they are locked but before you make that first trade, if you back out to go grab your stuff to trade they might lose that trade you wanted

If you guys want a vid I can make one since this is my own design based on things I‚Äôve seen different people do. I have not seen one do it this way, the closest I‚Äôve seen is Ph1lza does this but doesn‚Äôt realize zombie villagers that you make do the same thing.

I‚Äôll probably make the vid tomorrow or the next day once I finish it myself because my old world deleted itself so I had to start over

Edit: forgot to mention that villagers only take on trades during certain times of the day

Edit 2: should also give advice on getting emeralds. With this technique not many emeralds and needed so the farmer isn‚Äôt needed. This is mainly because the librarian sells 3 bookcases for 1 emerald after you cure them. 1 emerald buys you 9 books than sell those books back to the same villager for 1 emerald for 1 book or something close.

1773,gh2e0qu,t3_kk478s,"I lol'd, but then realized I should add - those controllers are really useful for tons of stuff besides bleep-blooping on your Playtation 5. You can bleepbloop that controller with (usually) minimal effort to a Windows PC or Raspberry Pi, for example, or you can connect to other devices via the provided USB port.

I currently use a Playstation 4 Dualshock bluetooth'd into a Raspberry Pi 4 in my living room that doubles as a home theater PC and cloud-gaming access point using Steamlink - so the games are actually processed on my personal computer in my room with the video feed and input/output tunneled to the Pi via LAN. This was shockingly easy to set up (I'm a nerd but not an especially capable one) and the Dualshock is a total champ for all of the above purposes. I'm guessing the extra input capabilities of the PS5 controller will work just as well on other platforms, just as the big center-button ""touchpad"" and internal gyro of the DualShock 4 are both *fully* functional on my raspberry pi (they literally control the mouse cursor in the OS, how badass is that?).

As a sidenote, the Steamlink is alarmingly capable - so far it has run all of the games I have attempted on similar quality settings as when I sit at my actual desk, and I don't even plug my computer directly into the router - it's just on the typical WiFi \~5.4 Ghz signal with about \~150 mbps of throughput on average, by my testing... then the pi is Cat 6'd into the router direct, gigabit/sec ethernet port... and running AAA games from just a few years ago at 1080p, 60 hz on our home television is not only tolerable, it is downright passable, with total additional input/display latency typically hovering around a very manageable \~100 ms. Obviously not ideal if you're a competitive street fighter player.

First of all they could release a cheaper model which allowed you to only buy the console and keep using your old controller (given how expensive they are). Second, you could buy a new controller and use it with your old system (PS4 controller works with PS3 for example).

And it wouldn't be complicated at all, PS4 already has a built in controller overlay where you could map and reassign whatever buttons you need, so developers wouldn't have to do anything. Just remap buttons on the system level and that's it.

With a mouse you can vary the speed your crosshair moves dramatically, you can either adjust it slowly or you can flip it 180¬∞ in an instant. Your aim speed with a controller is capped to a much narrower range though. So while you can up the aim speed in some games so you can do those quick snaps you lose the ability to make small precise movements.

But yeah a lot of the time someone can fly over your head in a console FPS and by the time you've turned around they're gone. I find it very difficult to lose my target when playing with mouse and keyboard but it happens all the time on a controller.",/r/gaming/comments/kk478s/my_parents_late_70s_got_me_a_ps5_controller_for/gh0wqjx/,Rejusu

At the same time there'd be people claiming people who used m+kb converter peripherals were cheating.

Much like with the current switch to 60fps in this generation, once you actually get to experience it, you can't really ignore it. Luckily there also seems to be some signs of native m+kb support on this generation with some big ticket games adding it in as standard as well.

Looking back through videos though, it seems like Halo 2 is an exception. Every other game, 1-5 shows him only with the assault rifle, all-though 5 was a bit harder to tell with all the other spartans so I may be wrong.

4056,eau4eh3,t1_eau3ff3,"Ok, so this game is written with a very cool new type of engine from what I have been able to gather from playing the ever-loving shit out of it.

It writes the story as you play based on what you do, see, and hear as Arthur.

To that end, you can re-write chapter 1 to be a bunch of different scenarios depending on what you do. Failing a chekpoint 3 times lets you skip it, and the narrative extrapolation algorithms fill in the blanks on their own. Following roads helps.

Turn off auto-save, save your game, then start a new one. I think it might be important that you have 2 different save files, but more data on that would be nice.

Some of the options I have found:

Making it look like Arthur was out all night looking for John

Playing murder investigator with Dutch and Micah

Having the Adler house sequence be Sadie's dream where she substituted Arthur for her husband

An actual party going on at the Adler house (no idea how that one happened, but I think you need to rush there and have you, Dutch, and Micah arrive at the same time)

And the default O'Driscoll fight

I am sure there are a lot of other scenarios waiting to be written.

It is important which frame you skip the opening text on for deciding your group's starting alignment.

Skipping parts of the opening cinematic can save both Davey and Jenny.

To save Davey you need to skip the wagon scene at the right point and the next scene after Ms Grimshaw sets up camp, but before Abigail notices he is dead.

I haven't been able to figure out what saves Jenny, but got her to be alive in about 1 scenario out of 10

Skipping the dialogue for any point at which Dutch is mentioned as leader, as well as making ***good*** decisions makes you the leader of the gang by default.

The front page of your journal has a gang roster, which jobs you pulled and with whom, and your earnings/gang savings from each job.

For best possible results train up your stats during chapter 1. Running in the snow is the best way to train your stamina, and you can level up your melee skills during the O'Driscoll barn ambush by repeating it. It makes life a lot easier later on.",/r/gaming/comments/a1yofz/i_got_off_the_horse_by_accident_right_before_a/eau4eh3/,GameShill

That being said the number of requests to aol/msn messenger, skype, facetime ect that I got in direct messaging was always intense.

Now that I'm married it's a whole different thing. When guys find out I'm a chick and tell them I'm married suddenly is HIGHLY offensive to them. Like how dare I not be just single and waiting for them to come alone and sweep me off my feet. Lots of requests for ""just some pics, he doesn't have to know"" like I'd ditch a perfectly happy marriage for some random jackass on the internet.

I've mostly transitioned to offline games, more because they fit what I'm into lately but I definitely don't miss the gamer dudes.

4327,gpehahd,t3_lvcakc,"As a psychologist I find these interactions between male and female gamers very weird. They very often have this outlook that the men saying these stuff are toxic or manipulative, and the girls are victims of this approach. What I often see is that these men have very little social skills. They try their best to get in touch with these girls, whom they view as strong, desirable and competent, in a way that they think is good. 

Some of them have really learnt that Mario(no joke) and Link are good role models. Not because they are depictions of how men actually behave, but because a lot of these boys and men have lacked a proper positive masculine role model in their real life. They use what they know. A man or boy being overly chivalrous, to a point where it‚Äôs weird even, is probably doing so because he has a very positive view of the girl he is talking to. And in his mind being kind and a good man(hero) for this girl means being chivalrous, coming to her aid, like Mario or Link(especially link is a very relatable character as he is brave, handsome and strong). To me this is nothing to make fun of. It‚Äôs rather very sad to see these boys and men try their best to reach out to someone they view as highly positive, and are left being made fun of and misunderstood. 

And make no mistake about it - you girls are viewed as positive! Some of these men might be weird, make you feel uncomfortable, some even toxic making gestures or approaches that is highly inappropriate. Being a girl meeting these men(online) is often difficult and very taxing because the men are lacking social skills that creates a good atmosphere. Since it‚Äôs the girls who know better in that situation they are the ones that finds it most uncomfortable. But, almost all the time their approaches and behaviour stems from them viewing you as positive. Not just attractive, but positive. Girls are viewed as kinder, emotionally smarter, easier to talk to, safer. A girl is a good friend too, and a lot of these men are missing that. Like they are sitting alone in the sandbox in kindergarten. And when they are weird, they are trying their best. When they ask if you have a boyfriend it‚Äôs their best attempt to find out if they can move closer or not. If they are toxic it‚Äôs because they often are angry that they are missing the positives a girl represents in their own life. Girls are in this story so much stronger than these men. 

It is these men‚Äôs responsibility to mature and learn other ways to talk to girls, especially online. But it is so important to understand where these boys and men are coming from, to see the value they put on to you women. It is a sadness to see posts like this, because it makes it clear how these men are perceived. Them reaching out and doing their best comes across as weird and toxic. Imagine how much they struggle to get in touch with people, girls in particular. Imagine how lonely they are. 

In my experience knowing where a behaviour comes from makes handling the impact of that behaviour a lot easier. Understand that a toxic man is being so because he finds what a woman represents unattainable. It‚Äôs a positive excluded from him. Downgrading female gamers is his way of dealing with that loss. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care anyway, I don‚Äôt need a girl in my life, they suck!‚Äù. Now he can believe that he can be okey without. Try to notice that dynamic, and see if you can feel some compassion for how isolated some of them feel. If you do, the toxic man is shown for the sad boy he feels to be, and his comments no longer as threatening.",/r/gaming/comments/lvcakc/boy_gamer/gpehahd/,BosskingNorway

4596,gpbvxnk,t3_lvcakc,"From a woman's perspective, here's a few ways to help shut down this behavior as a guy:

Speak up when a guy starts talking like this to a woman. If you don't speak up, you're a slient participant letting this toxic mentality continue.

Stop making any jokes about gamer girls, even satirically. Sarcastically saying over the mic ""are you a giiiirrrrrrlllll"" is still going to be harassing them. Even making a bunch of gamer girl jokes not directed at a particular person still makes us feel like we can't speak. It. is. not. funny. Sarcasm should be saved for people you really know, not strangers.

If you have to pretend a girl gamer is a guy to treat them like a person, you need to reevaluate your inner prejudices. If you don't know how to interact with a woman online, look at how you should interact with women, or really any human, IRL.

It's crazy how hard it is for a lot of men and boys to be kind. If you think you're kind but still do these gamer girl jokes and harassment, check again.

If a woman needs help in-game, she'll ask for it. You don't need to rescue her or be her protector unless the game actually calls for that. If you wouldn't offer the same help to a guy, don't offer it to a woman.

Flashforward to Apex being huge and crossplat: We were playing trios with and rando so her and I were just shooting the shit over game comms (since I was on PC and she was on Xbox) when the rando starts vomiting advice. Her and I being in the same room just looked at each other as this guy ranted, completely unprompted, about how Apex is best played, about how Octane (the champ she was playing) should be used, about how many games he's won, etc. I've literally never listened to something that cringey first hand, but the fucking cherry was him offering to give her lessons.

Most would at least feel happy to have women go out of their way to try to make them feel welcomed. 


Are we also seriously going to ignore the fact that most women still have an overwhelmingly negative attitude towards gaming, or nerdy hobbies/men in general, and that men shouldn't be surprised or enthralled when they find something that is still relatively uncommon? More evidence to this is how common it is for women to try to shame or attack nerdy guys for trying to express any kind of attraction towards them, effectively shaming them for having desires or feelings because they are men/nerdy. The very premise of this comic, which implies that men should feel shame, or are somehow evil/creeps, for having or expressing an attraction to women, clearly demonstrates that very type of negative attitude.",/r/gaming/comments/lvcakc/boy_gamer/gpfhncb/,ArdentGamer

I started getting into gaming in high school but I wasn't very good as I hadn't played video games my whole life. People harassed me for being a girl and I couldn't shut them down because I wasn't good enough. It was super frustrating.

Now I'm an engineer and I have this need to make sure all my work is perfect before sending it out, even for very inconsequential things like a casual email. My boss (a very badass lady) has been encouraging me to have more confidence in my work and she commented that this is very common among female engineers. It seems like, in male-dominated industries, women have to do everything perfectly in order to prove themselves, whereas that same pressure isn't applied as much to men.

* Unnecessarily bringing up perverts in intro (why say ""not a pervert but I like you being here"", it's the sex-pest version of ""I'm not racist but..."")

I felt bad so I told them all to shut up, let her play, and to just play the game. They all start screaming that I'm just doing it cuz I like her, or that she's my girlfriend or something. She goes really quiet and leaves a few minutes later. I quit after that.

5417,gpc4b5o,t1_gpbiild,"yeah this is a very well-known phenomenon.  computers themselves used to be ""women's work"" but the *second* it became lucrative suddenly it was a masculine thing - earliest programmers were women.  same in any industry, a lot were originally established by women and then as they become lucrative it then becomes male dominated and women start being questioned about their competency.

a lot of it has to do with sex roles established in the 20th century with men as ""breadwinners"" earning extremely large incomes that'd make millenials and zoomers heads spin, enough to support a family with a subservient and purely domestic unemployed wife.  so any job that started paying well was just automatically made masculine.

this ties into modern incel movements, as now wages have fallen far, far below what boomers earned but the sex roles remain.  for those in relationships, both parties have to work to survive, which emasculates men who feel like it's impossible for them to live up these outdated masculine standards and of course drains women who both have to work *and* are expected to do all the ""women's work"" of a relationship in order to soothe the ego of their partner.  so we get a lot of reactionary young dudes, many of whom are single and feel they can't actually date unless they earn a lot of money (and very few people can nowadays), angry as shit at women for ""taking away"" the life promised to them by the 50's in the US and further and further alienated.  you get incels, the alt-right, and of course the call of duty playerbase.

I always keep an emergency-snack like some beef jerky or one of those little wheels of cheese tucked under my balls.

From there, the next step is to get creative. You‚Äôre not just flexing the business side; get creative and artistic with it. Do some finger painting with your dick. Dress it up and put on a puppet show for her. Remember, she‚Äôs been sent thousands of pictures of penises in her lifetime. You‚Äôve gotta set yours apart.

5585,gpeb8l6,t1_gpc1bva,"I know ""house-husbands"" have been a thing for a while, but unfortunately its not universally accepted, so your husband is lucky to have someone like you as an understanding wife.

my friend became a paraplegic after a horrible motorcycle accident returning from work. His wife left him 4 months later, and expected him to move out, as to not affect her new relationships. Keeping in mind that he needs care, so has needed to hire a carer. They also have a young son together, and it's been a struggle for my friend to see him.

This is not an isolated event in my circle of friends. Depression caused the end of a 5 year relationship of another friend, after he struggled to work full-time. Its honestly scary how some partners are willing to jump ship, after loss of income. On one hand I get it, men in relationships generally make more money, so it's scary to lose that, but it's also cold AF. How will I know if my future wife will truly stay with me ""in sickness and in health""? There's no guarantees it seems.

If they wanted to make this the equivalent of Expert difficulty, they'd need to have 2,021 mines - that would be freaking impressive.

If you don't know yet, try to clear off ones you do know to hopefully get you more information. The numbers indicates how many bombs are touching that tile. If the flattened tile say 1, and you only have 1 raised tile touching it, it's obviously that's a bomb. But if it say 1, but you have 2 raised tile, you'll have to determine which one.

6831,hwxrrne,t1_hwxnx40,"[Let's start with a more basic example.](https://minesweeper.online/img/homepage/intermediate.png)

It's worth nothing that if you click a square that has zero surrounding mines, it will automatically uncover connecting squares that also don't have bombs.  With this example, if you clicked the top right corner, it'd open up that entire empty top right area and show the numbers surrounding it.

Then it's deduction and you build from there.  For example, let's consider the section on the very far right.  That 1 in the corner must be next to exactly mine.  There is only 1 spot it can be, as out of the 8 surrounding squares, only one is not already revealed.

So you right click that corner to mark it as having a mine.  Now that you know a mine is there, all those OTHER 1s next to it are satisfied as well.  That means none of the other squares they touch can possibly be mines, so you can safely click them to see what number they hold.

There are other combos you learn to see.  Like if you are working along a straight edge and have a 1 and a 2 next to each other.  Both the 1 and 2 will have access to 3 squares each.  There will be two squares both of them touch, and one off to either side that only one or the other reach.

This means exactly one of those shared squares will contain a mine, since that's the only way the 2 can touch 2 and the 1 only touch 1.  Then you can reason there is a mine by the 2 where the 1 cannot reach, and there is not a mine to the other side of the 1 (as there must be a mine in one of the two squares they both share).

So that solved 2 of those 4 squares, and it's 50/50 on the two they both touch.  Hopefully by working more of the puzzle and working back to that spot, it'll become obvious which it is.  99% of the time that is possible, though with some versions of the game it can come down to a coin flip.",/r/gaming/comments/ssf7zr/minesweeper_99_x_99_1500_mines_took_me_about_25/hwxrrne/,Day_Bow_Bow

2 reasons to do this. For one, speed, as it allows you to clear the game a little faster. A less important reason is that sometimes you can be unsure at a glance if you'd flagged all the mines in an area. Chording a few numbers and seeing if anything opens up can take some mental strain away and potentially speed things up.

It's important to note that if you misflagged any adjacent mines its' game-over. If you flag too many mines chording will fail but you won't lose.

8342,ebfzk86,t3_a4lc3z,"This is a strategy which once failed for my parents one Christmas Eve.

I was given a slot car racer track, and because we were driving to the other grandparents house on Christmas day, I was told I could stay up until I crashed. The other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.

When I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.

For the rest of the evening my Father tried in vain to knock me from the track. He used every dirty trick he could, and because of the way the cars power were distributed, it often meant I could cause his plans to backfire. I'm sure it was only a few minutes that I held on, but to a kid my age it was practically all night.",/r/gaming/comments/a4lc3z/play_until_we_lose/ebfzk86/,chinpokomon

But more importantly, you guys pitch forking at EA are missing the obvious. EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children. 

I would imagine should bad press go viral enough for disney to notice, theyd be calling a board meeting with EA pretty sharpish.

9415,dprhvy0,t3_7cog1u,"I keep saying this to all my friends. What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively 'boo' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers. That gamers wont even be bothered to be aware/present at their biggest yearly exposition.

Edit: even I can't believe THIS is my top rated comment. I always assumed ""RIP inbox"" was a joke.

Edit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it's all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write 'best in E3 show!' 'Battlefront 2 made me cry!' '#newEAgamelooksdope' bias is part of their resume. 'Yes man' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal 'reporters' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who've been in a guild, it's common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That's their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO's start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I'm favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney. I agree with u/roxwar. >EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children.

I'd assume Disney saw the EA stocks and figured they could do no wrong. Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80's. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games. We must learn to adult as gamers.",/r/gaming/comments/7cog1u/can_we_please_boycott_star_wars_battlefront_2/dprhvy0/,Zerovarner

We got the game every year... always hype for the early release in September!  But then nothing in the game was ever improving, the game felt worse with each release.  Each iteration of the game felt like a dumb downed recycled version of the last.  Every year the game felt more random and we were losing actual control of of our players.  Frustration finally led to all of us not buying 17.  My brother tried the 18 beta and was like yeah nevermind I know why we stopped.  


The only thing they update and care about is their HUT bullshit.  Because people drop stacks to buy more and more card packs.

When they announced that there was finally going to be a new Battlefront game, I was so excited.  I couldn't wait to rush out and buy it the second it came out!

And then it turned out to be a toxic pile of sludge.  I never bought it.  I won't be buying EA's Battlefront 2 either.  And the whole thing just makes me really sad.

After the disappointment of EA's first Battlefront game, I discovered that the original Star Wars Battlefront 2 is available on steam for like $5-10.

When a grind of this magnitude is introduced into a game, players automatically look for a way speed up or bypass their progression, it makes it obvious that this is obnoxious bait to get you to succumb to their micro-transactions, why would people spend 40 hours of their busy lives trying to unlock one thing when they could just pay some arbitrary fee to unlock it instantly, Its forced convenience, It's shady, and its a disease afflicting modern gaming.

Its real shame too, 'cause I love Star Wars and the game itself looks fun as hell, but when a company like EA is so blatantly stretching out progression to insane levels, only to ask us for more money to make it shorter? its hard to enjoy it.

We are not playing Candy Crush here, these are Triple-A games, where progression should be fair and balanced and react to the skill and effort of the one playing, not the whims of Corporate exec's trying to line their back pockets with the money of people who don't know better.

It was more of rushed outpouring of my thoughts at the time rather than a well put together argument.

9459,dproq6f,t3_7cog1u,"My father in law doesn't really play a lot of video games. He especially doesn't play shooters. But he loves Star Wars, absolutely adores it and everything related to it. In recent years he works less than he used to so when they released that PS4 package with battlefront and the darth Vader skin he bought it. Since the day he bought that he plays it for at least a while every single day he can. He could give a shit how it compares to other shooters, he doesn't care about shooters the last game he played on console was probably crash bandicoot. He doesn't care if it's expensive he has plenty of money and it's like the only game he has to pay for anyway. I guarantee you he already has the most expensive version preordered and he will drop a couple hundred on release if he has to to unlock everything. He doesn't care about video games or developer ethics, he just really really likes Star Wars, and the battlefield style gameplay and graphics really immerse him in the universe he loves.

This game is for him not you and EA knows that. 

That's why EA bought the rights.

That's why EA could give a shit if redditors play the game, after the last release they knew half of us would shit on it even if it was perfect and none of us would spend any real money.

Where have you guys been the past decade? EA butchers one game after another. 

My favorite game, of all time is NFS Most wanted (2005 mind you). It was the perfect game for the young racing car loving fuck I was back then. I played it up and down on my PS2. Years later, after being busy with work and stuff, I've seen in a store a new NFS game. It was Most wanted (2012) and came out 3 days after my birthday. Without hesistation I bought it.

It was the saddest shit i've ever seen. The game was not even ""Most Wanted"" anymore. It was just hot garbage shovelware that doesn't actually reassemble the original Title at all. I felt scammed and of course, no refund. That was the day I swore I will never give EA money again. Yet, to this day, they still exist. 

It's probably those casual dudebros that are totally into these hot garbage games and that keep the company running, but for me I want it dead.

To Whom It May Concern;

As a die-hard Star Wars Fan since the original films hit the theaters and Disney shareholder, I feel obligated to voice my objections to the frustrating developments within video game products featuring characters which I love. EA Games is quickly driving the Star Wars intellectual property off a high cliff with their shady business practices. Specifically, the Battlefront II game will feature a pay-to-win gambling system designed to present players with a choice after their initial purchase of $60-$100: Spend unreasonable amounts of time to unlock content within the game or spend additional cash for a random chance to unlock this same content.

This business model is prevalent in portable gaming where the price for entry into the game is significantly lower. It seems like a blatant cash grab in a premium title for home consoles. There's already been a backlash of millions of gamers against the game on the popular web community, Reddit.com. EA has garnered the dubious title of having the ""most downvoted comment in history"" for their response to a fan inquiry about the fairness of these micro-transactions.

You can view that exchange here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/

The first Battlefront game has been widely panned by gamers and this latest sequel seems to cast an even darker shadow across an otherwise beloved franchise. I urge you to cut ties with Electronic Arts which was previously voted the ""Worst Company in America"" two years in a row. Just today, Forbes published another scathing article regarding the very situation I'm writing you about. You can find that article here: https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/11/13/in-2017-ea-has-turned-into-an-industry-punching-bag-once-again/#27496ea6224d

I want you to know that I am a consumer, a parent, a shareholder, and an influencer of friends and family when it comes to technology purchases. I can promise you that, until these games make a significant shift away from micro-transactions and the encouragement of gambling, I will steer everyone I can away from purchasing any Star Wars related products. I'm a firm believer in voting with my wallet, but I also will make sure to get the word out to others if nothing is done about this reprehensible business practice.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this and will be happy to discuss further, if there are any questions. 

Kind Regards,",/r/gaming/comments/7cog1u/can_we_please_boycott_star_wars_battlefront_2/dps28a8/,VerbalTease

Sure there might be a few games with them but the last decade has gone away from dedicated servers and regardless of that, those that did have them _were usually run by the community!_ I know, because I use to host one of the most popular servers back in early CoD 1 and CoD 2 days....Then you've got those who blindly believe what Dev's and Publishers tell them despite the _constant_ downgrading of titles (Every Ubisoft title ever) the mis-advertised (No mans Sky etc) and the constant ""we won't have Microtransactions in _our_ game, followed up by having MT's in their game (So many examples)

For as long as we have those people, then it's unfortunately never going to change. EA and the like will be rolling around laughing ""look at these idiots complaining while giving us billions of moneys""

Gamers are a fickle bunch, we argue a lot in game and on forums, we all love and hate certain games and demographics that go along with them and it's like we're at war with each other in game, but out in the real world we seek each other out and get excited when we meet like minded players.

If for once we could actually just band together we could have nipped this in the bud before it got this bad but there will always be ""but it's Starwars I'll do it on the next game, or ""it's a Naughty Dog game"", or it's ""Red dead redemption! this is _different!_"" and there will always be a game, because ""reasons"" that stops the community from banding together and preventing the future from getting worse. 

On a similar note, Take Two have announced that *every future title of theirs will have microtransations*

https://www.pcgamesn.com/take-two-service-games-only

>‚ÄúWe aim to have recurrent consumer spending options for every title that we put out at this company. It may not always be an online model. It probably won't always be a virtual currency model, but there'll be some ability to engage on an ongoing basis with our titles after release across the board.

So that's what? RDR2? GTAVI? Borderlands 3? Civilization 7, Any future Bioshock and the million others? 

Of course, Take Two aren't the only ones with Activision rolling out TWO *patents* in the most disgusting corporate bullshit of building a database on you using _you_ as a player to either be bait to convince a new player into buying their super duper weapon pack or tricking you into buying it

http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-18-activision-patented-method-of-tuning-matchmaking-to-boost-microtransactions

Or we have Blizzard (or Activision-Blizzard I guess) trying to claim that they are some-how _different_ and not a problem

http://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-president-on-loot-boxes-i-dont-think-overwatch-belongs-in-that-controversy/

Or Ubisoft throwing them in everything but so far been quiet (for them at least) but actually making more money through MT's than game sales so we can expect them in everything
https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/309155/For_the_first_time_Ubisofts_microtransactions_outearned_digital_game_sales.php but of course we must not forget the fact you can't buy JUST a game anymore without a ton of crap, take Watch Dogs 2 with it's:
- Standard Edition
- Deluxe Edition
- Vigilante Edition
- Uplay Exclusive Edition
- Limited Edition
- DedSec Edition
- Digital Deluxe Edition
- Uplay Deluxe Edition

But that obviously isn't including the pre-order bonuses and other random crap DLC. 

and of course, we can't forget Warner Brothers with their pathetic attempt at trying to pull at your heart strings with the recent loss of one of their developers in Shadow of War and trying to monetize on his death.

We've had Deus Ex horrific pre-order bonuses which, thankfully to backlash for pulled but with Square Enix now wanting episodic (Read also as, unfinished titles seeing how well the first parts sell so they know what to commit to the next) 

Because we, as gamers have allowed this for so long, and because [insert whatever silly reason here] someone thinks MT's is fine, publishers will continue to push it further and further. We will continue to get content deliberately cut, we will continue to get games developed for _microtransactions_ and delivered around _you_ spending as much money as possible for as little content as possible, all while being laughed at and insulted by developers, publishers and community managers like EA recently telling us how we're Armchair developers, well apparently, they get to tell YOU what YOU _must_ like in your title. 

_We all have one thing in common_, we all like games. So why are still people blind on seeing how MT's and shady business practices are hurting the gaming industry for the player and keeping it from innovating _GAMES_ but spending the time on innovating _how to take your money_. It's _not_ feeding developers, it's just letting the CEO's and shareholders buy their 3rd mansion. 

---------------------------------------------------------
TLDR?

Sigh. Microtransactions.

9573,dprnqkc,t3_7cog1u,"Not sure how I feel, you can't say no to a game about any extra purchases but I don't like paying for any advantage and would rather be cosmetic only but in Star Wars I'd hate custom storm troopers, they all should be white and none should be without helmets like in the first one. 

DLC is honestly fine by me but not if they get a game and cut some off and sell DLC back, Witcher 3 did it the best when they released a content filled game and gave out even more, Battlefield 4 did this but not as great as the base game only had 11 maps but the rest of the game was good other than the launch. 

Paying to win seems to be the main topic but this game is a bit more of a grey area, it's not like mobile games where theres no way of progression past a certain point but it's like Rainbow Six Siege where you can either buy or grind, I'd say it's somewhere between GTA Online's extortion and R6 Sieges season pass, probably closer to Siege tbh. I still feel that no money  should give any advantage but free DLC and a good single player is a good bonus though. These days though you can't expect a company not to do any type of additional sales but I would rather cosmetics if it was not Star Wars. I may get it but I am playing the 10 hours for free tomorrow since I got a day off to.

9734,dpru2bk,t3_7cog1u,"[PC] I won't be buying this game until it hits the $5.00USD price point. I picked up the previous SWBF Ultimate Edition for $5.00USD a couple months ago. Pretty game, but not the sandbox full of toys I want to hit me in the feels from 40 years ago. I like the Battlefield games, BF1 has especially been a lot of fun for me, and I bought premium. I knew I would want the new maps and it was cheaper at the time. Considering the time I and the GF's son has put into that game and had fun, it was worth it. Of course any division of your player base is bad for them and for the business. Just go try and find a Rush game on the French Maps on PC.



I used to love EA, because I am a huge Hockey Fan. The NHL games EA used to make in the early to late 2000s were fantastic. They were feature rich and detailed. Multiple game modes, easter eggs, great soundtracks, control. You could adjust the passing speed, penalty frequency, puck friction etc. You could absolutely tell that the developers of those games LOVED the sport. The same can pretty much be said for the EA NCAA Football games (RIP). And then there is the Tiger Woods series. I wore out my Tiger Woods 2009 disc (Xbox 360.) I have never played golf, but I loved that game. Space helmets, kilts, endless customization and hours of couch coop. TW2009 was a masterpiece. 



That is all gone these days. They removed a bunch of game modes and features from the NHL games, and add one or two back every year now. None of them felt right. The music was all wrong for Hockey, no big head mode, no franchise options to decrease the price of concessions. Hell, no franchise mode. An empty shell.



I bought Rory McBurgerKings' PGA Tour - a newer Xboxone title with hopes it would rekindle the greatness that existed OVER SEVEN YEARS AGO. Rory was trash and as shallow as POTUS. Even the graphics were a step back. 



The customer base for Star Wars likely dwarfs the EA sports fans. But that is what will happen eventually. EA will remove Heroes altogether one year, and then slowly add them back as a new features. Its kinda like why companies have to lay off unskilled employees; because giving them another raise is not cost effective, its fiscally more beneficial to start over. 



Video games on the whole are much more inexpensive these days. I think I paid $30.00USD ($78.00 adjusted) for THGTTG in 1984, although it did come with belly button lint, and a microscopic space fleet. So we got that goin for us. CYBERPUNK 2077!!!!

I don't know why not buying things that are money sinks and chopped into pieces to manipulate you is so hard for people. 

My brother has spent over $300 on loot boxes in Overwatch, something completely optional and only for aesthetics. I can't imagine how much people sink into games that have more than just cosmetics behind paywalls. It's insane. The most I've ever spent in microtransactions is $35 over the course of two years in Heroes of the Storm which is a free game that I desperately wish I could just pay $60 for all heroes current and future and buy it as a complete game. Since I can't do that I have quit playing it.

I don't fuck around with money sinks period. I quit MMO's too the second I see a BAG for inventory space will cost me $20 real world money. ",/r/gaming/comments/7cog1u/can_we_please_boycott_star_wars_battlefront_2/dprvejv/,BenjaminTalam

Activision

Valve
YouTube

Disney
Bandai

Finally: we need to hold accountable. There is a systemic problem with parents letting game consoles raise their kids, and a disproportionate amount of the micro transaction purchases in these games are coming from little 12 and under kids who want to be like their favorite YouTube moron and have every gun imaginable, to the tune of hundreds of dollars. Today‚Äôs parents are every bit as responsible for this as the above listed companies are. This is especially true in mobile gaming.

Sony and Microsoft are NOT competitors - they've created tiny platform exclusive closed marketplaces which they can inflate and deflate whenever they want.

For the future of gaming PC gamers and console gamers need to unite - but how can we break the chains when so many will fight to the death to keep them out of nothing more than brand loyalty?

You know those USB security dongles they use for protecting the software people use to make CGI for Hollywood movies, or military laptops?

It's like that - but it's huge and costs 400 dollars and ALL YOU GET is whatever they decide to give you - and once you're invested - you'll buy every single thing on the platform because what else are you gonna do with it?

To whom this may concern,

I would just like to voice my personal disgust with the approach that EA is taking within terms of the micro-transactions being offered in Stars Wars Battlefront II.  The fact that a character like Darth Vador is purchasable for REAL WORLD MONEY is despicable.  Good job on promoting loot-box gambling aimed at children.  This entire fiasco just reminds me of why EA is consistently rated one of the worst companies in America.  It has been a blight on the gaming industry as a whole for many years now.  Consuming smaller, more innovative game developers and turning their prized works into hollow shells of their former glory and ruining their beloved franchises in the process.  I hope one day you reconsider your partnership with such morally bankrupt company.

This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but as long as users can acquire stuff through in game currency without spending real money, I have no problem with them offering the real money portion as well. In the past 20-30 years, the price of video games has stayed relatively the same with the price to create them going up exponentially. A 60$ game now takes 100 million+ to create, and it didn't in the past. Part of the way they recoup this investment is through pre-orders and micro transactions.

Do we all hate microtransactions? For the most part yeah. Are they going away? No. They can actually be super beneficial for a game environment. For instance, heroes of the storm is free because they have microtransactions. 

I'm not saying I support ea's decisions, but it's crazy hypocritical of all of you to crucify EA at the stake but give other companies a pass.

Before EA made a PR disaster out of this whole thing, I was on Reddit crusading against this game and it's exploitative nature; it is pay to win, let's not split hairs about it. I would post on various forums and threads to try to get others to see the light and I received an insane amount of hate for it. I'm glad people are finally coming around in big numbers, better late than never and I mean that sincerely. 

I am a huge Star Wars fan, going way back to when I was a little kid and watched *A New Hope* for the first time with my dad. I was hooked instantly. I owned the original Battlefront games (the good ones) on the OG Xbox, and I bought the 2015 Battlefront for the Xbone a few days after it launched. That was the only game I played for days. I loved it so much (hindsight is 20/20, it was 100% nostalgia, the game was bare bones), all I could think was I wanted more content so I bought the season pass. Long story short I got burned for almost $120. That's no one's fault but my own, even though I blame EA for shitty scumbag business practices and making a fucking season pass $50. It split the player base up to an unplayable state, the same thing is happening all over again right now to Battlefield 1. 

When the ring of YouTube reviewers I trust (AngryJoe, TB, ACG etc.) began coming out saying this game was pay to win, I was immediately turned off. Then I played the ""beta"" or as actual gamers like to call it the ""demo"", and my only thought was ""hm, I've played this game before. It's the same damn thing, just a polished turd."" Suffice to say I will spend my money elsewhere. It's not a *great* game to start with and the loot boxes make it criminal. We, as gamers, should not and will not stand for this bullshit. This game will probably sell millions of copies, I won't lie. However, 130K people read OP's post and gave it an upvote. If that many potential customers choose to say *fuck this game*, it will absolutely hurt EA's sales. It certainly won't bankrupt them and it probably won't even affect their quarterly bottom line, but we can make a stand and tell these fucking walking dollar signs, who by the way know *nothing* about games or gamers to go fuck themselves.

9973,dps2hop,t3_7cog1u,"Little late to the ‚ÄúFuck EA‚Äù party, but the decision for me was made when the first Battlefront came out and had an unbelievably small pool of maps, and no single player campaign. Sure. maybe the graphics in video games are getting better all the time, and it takes work to make a game super pretty and well optimized, but I‚Äôd rather wait for a game to come out with more maps and, ya know, a single player mode, especially when it‚Äôs based on one of the most popular entertainment franchises ever.

The opportunity to create a compelling campaign and large, beautiful map pool for a Star Wars video game in 2017 is, well, endless. I‚Äôd rather have a game that doesn‚Äôt give me the dichotomous option of ‚Äúunbelievable commitment and innumerable hours of my life wasted to unlock a single hero‚Äù or ‚Äúpay to unlock a hero/villain that you‚Äôve found cool since childhood after you spend $60/$80 on a video game already.‚Äù I‚Äôd rather sacrifice those stunning 4k features and details to create the best attempt at realism for a single player story. Sure, plenty of people skip the campaign modes in Call of Duty or Battlefield, which are video game franchises, and I‚Äôm included in that. But for the first Battlefront to be so limited as to not have the option when there were countless directions and decades of Star Wars history/movies for it to have gone and be modeled after, it was a easy deterrent to wasting my money.

When it comes to Battlefront 2, no amount of beautiful trailers or HD laser beams and particle effects will get me to spend a week‚Äôs pay (I‚Äôm a college student and work part-time, okay) on a game that I won‚Äôt be able to enjoy until a month or two down the road when I get a hero or two. I fully support having to earn heroes, but making them more difficult to obtain in order to get me to break out my shiny new credit card and spend even more money is just uncool. So, I‚Äôm happy to boycott the hell out of this game, and subsequent EA games.

>Good afternoon,

>I feel it is my duty to voice my displeasure on how EA Games is handling the Star Wars IP.  I had planned on paying full retail price for the upcoming Battlefront II game, and until recently there was little that would temper my excitement.

>However, the microtransaction system that EA has implemented in the form of ""Loot Crates"" is a travesty to gaming, the Star Wars brand, and your customers.

>Under normal gaming circumstances I completely understand content being blocked off until a certain amount of play is completed.  However, taking over 40 hours to unlock A SINGLE hero character (Darth Vader) is preposterous.  Even more so, other players can gain a SIGNIFICANT competitive advantage by purchasing Loot Crate with real world money.  It takes so long to unlock anything without actually purchasing it that it feels like a blatant ploy to rip off customers.

>This is a standard model for ""Freemium"" cell phone games and should NOT exist in a AAA experience where I've already spent 60 dollars.  Even worse, it encourages younger children, who will certainly be playing the game, to gamble and presses them to be irresponsible with their money due to the slow trickle of content.

>EA is really tarnishing the brand, currently they have a comment on Reddit (a community based content site) that is the MOST DOWNVOTED in the history of the website.  Currently at almost HALF A MILLION negative impressions. 
That can be viewed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/

>This is just one voice, but I intend to not purchase the game anymore, and if this is how the Star Wars IP will be handled by other companies you've handed the license to, then I will certainly stop buying anything Star Wars altogether.

Quite simply it is way to easy for a company like EA to reach such a large audience that even if 80% of them outright Boycott it simply does not matter, they will still make WAY more off of their shadey business practices with the last 20% that does buy, then to be legit and gain the other 80 that was boycotting. Now does this reddit post have 80% of the exposure as EA?, No it has MAYBE 1% if that so that 80% is really 1, and EA doesn't give the slightest shit, hell it isn't even noticable for them, they are seeing record profits while you are Boycotting, If anything at this point they WANT you to boycott, hell if a Boycott reaches a news channel they get free advertising and probably make MORE sales from idiot exposure than the Boycott prevented.

Once again BOYCOTTS DO NOT WORK IN THE MODERN AGE. You want to hurt EA for their bullshit? Work to make their business practices illegal.

I mean seriously, If you played the beta for the upcoming battlefront 2 and are a fan of the original, yet think that this new one is bad, I don't even understand your argument. You're over here saying things like how the eras mixing is bad and not what we would want.. but.. that's literally exactly how the original game was, except now we also have the new era. That's literally exactly what people were saying was wrong with the original reboot upon release. Yes, in the original you can just get in a vehicle, but this game has a more balanced and useful point system than the original. Instead of giving heroes out to the best or a random player and allowing everyone to use vehicles, it actually tests everyone's skill and puts use to the little points you get for doing things in the match rather than just having a good score to be the best on the team. Not to mention, it allows vehicles to be accessed quite easily if you just play for a bit and then buy a vehicle with points you earn for actually playing the game instead of just being given a vehicle. It feels more fair. It is more fair. and it is more honorable to the originals. Not to mention all that free DLC shit.

Now that thats out of the way: Fuck the enables. No. Seriously. You people who in every new iteration of cashgrabs fill the reddit and other forums threads with ""but this time it'll be different! They promised!"", ""shut up, I dont want to hear about it, just pay or stfu"", ""this aint so bad"", ""microtransactions, lootboxes are okay as long as they promise to keep them cosmetic"". FUCK HAVING THE MEMORY OF A GOLDFISH. Fuck you enablers. Why fuck you? Because you are literally working together with these scumbag corporations that could care fuckall about us consumers by lowering the quality of every new game that is coming out. Yes, fucking believe me, the bar is being lowered for what these days is acceptable as a AAA release. If you would go back in time 10 years, explain to someone the actual piece of shit excuse for a AAA title that we are getting these days, THE PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND NOT BELIEVE YOU. THATS HOW BAD IT IS.

As long as people continue to defend and buy this garbage we have ended up now having as AAA titles, NOTHING WILL CHANGE. SO STOP FUCKING DEFENDING IT BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE DISGUSTING CORPORATIONS BY LOWERING THE BAR OF QUALITY WHILE RAISING THE BAR ON JUST HOW MUCH WE ACCEPT BEING FUCKED IN THE ASS.

Sorry but totally fuck this. FUCK GAMERS because you all arent stand up consumers, everyone in every other business and industry is laughing at JUST HOW BAD YOU ARE AT EXCERCISING YOUR CONSUMER RIGHTS, fuck defending to be fucked in the ass just because you are sick of hearing about it. Fuck being a consumer and not standing up for your consumer rights. Fuck accepting that they lowered the bar of AAA games so much, that we now sit here 10 years later wondering how much the games will SUCK prerelease instead of wondering how much they will ROCK, like we are supposed to. Fuck sitting around defending someone fucking you over, then going out to buy the game like a mindless drone and then going online to complain about it ad infinitum. Fuck becoming used to these business tactics so much that you become so lazy that you stop thinking for yourself and start letting *them* tell *you* what is acceptable and not the other way around. Fuck accepting a shitty state because its norm and you are annoyed by the people who dare to voice their opinion against consumer abuse. Fuck being the enabler to your own doom. Fuck calling vocal consumers who speak out because they still actually care about something entitled. What the fuck kind of sense of consumer rights is that?! 

Every fucking time pre release its the same shit, I see reddit threads FILLED with people saying ""it aint so bad, at least this one only has cosmetic lootboxes!"" and ""oh look a whole 8 hours campaign!"". Well where the fuck are we next year? ""At least in this one I only had to 40 hours to unlock a character!"" - wait scratch that, THAT IS ACTUALLY WHERE WE ARE NOW WHAT THE FUCK. 
Whether its EA, Ubisoft, Take2, Bethesda fucking you as the consumer: FUCK YOU FOR DEFENDING IT, YOU ARE ONLY MAKING THE PRODUCT WORSE FOR ALL OF US IN THE LONG RUN.

I said it a dozen times, but boycotting games is *almost* impossible. Reddit and other social networks are a tiny tiny fraction of the gaming market place, it is really really hard to get people on board of a boycott even under normal circumstances. 

But this is not normal circumstances. This is a STAR WARS game coming out right before the new STAR WARS movie. This game is going to sell extremely well even if you somehow made the entire gaming forums boycott the game. People will buy consoles for this, people who don't go on Reddit. 

**However**, people *do* go on twitter and maybe do a very quick google search about this ""new Star Wars game"". And if people can make enough of a stink online that it bleeds into the mainstream media, you won't be able to type ""star wars"" into any search bar without hearing about some kind of ""public backlash"" against STAR WARS.

Even if it doesn't hurt their sales, Disney won't be too happy about stuff like that so close to the release of the movie. 

So sure, ""vote with your wallet"", but it's way more important to make your voice heard. That might work. Even then there is of course the real possibility that most people will shrug and think ""but it's just a game?"".

What you're really asking is for press to stop covering EA games.  That puts the gaming press outlets in kinda a weird position though because their model is based on their audience, viewership, and clicks.  

What I'm trying to say is that there is no one easy solution for this.  I'd rather the entire industry focus on smaller indie titles that have interesting things to say than the bigger budget titles but that's not going to drive as much traffic.

Once I level up, then I can level the cards. I also have a theory that paid loot boxes won't give you high level cards until you level your character. I received only shitty greys and greens in my packs, with the exception of the pre-order and deluxe stuff. It's different than the beta.

I feel like the people complaining are the people who need to have everything right now.

As for the heroes, the paid loot boxes have no credit toward their purchase.

>Under normal gaming circumstances I completely understand content being blocked off until a certain amount of play is completed. However, taking over 40 hours to unlock A SINGLE hero character (Darth Vader) is preposterous. Even more so, other players can gain a SIGNIFICANT competitive advantage by purchasing Loot Crate with real world money. It takes so long to unlock anything without actually purchasing it that it feels like a blatant ploy to rip off customers.

>This is a standard model for ""Freemium"" cell phone games and should NOT exist in a AAA experience where I've already spent 60 dollars. Even worse, it encourages younger children, who will certainly be playing the game, to gamble and presses them to be irresponsible with their money due to the slow trickle of content.

>EA is really tarnishing the brand, currently they have a comment on Reddit (a community based content site) that is the MOST DOWNVOTED in the history of the website. Currently at almost HALF A MILLION negative impressions. That can be viewed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/

>This is just one voice, but I intend to not purchase the game anymore, and if this is how the Star Wars IP will be handled by other companies you've handed the license to, then I will certainly stop buying anything Star Wars altogether.

10587,dprx7kl,t1_dprtd1y,"Dear Disney Representative,
I have been a fan of your company since my earliest memories. I have so many precious family memories associated with your products and destinations. I love Disney and I love all that Disney represents. My grandparents love to recount how they were the first people to ride Space Mountain, which didn't even have seatbelts at the time. My grandma screamed so much she lost her voice and the park employees thought she had fallen off the ride. I feel a very real connection to your company. On top of that I am a die hard Star Wars fan and so far love everything you have done with the title, from The Force Awakens, to Rebels.
So imagine my dismay at what is happening with Battlefront II. It is worse than gambling because games like this will eventually be in the hands of children, but it's more than that. I bought Battlefront I and I felt like a buffoon for doing so. The game was beautiful and so perfectly crafted, but it felt so... dead... Like it has no soul. Like a Lamborghini without an engine. A beautiful woman with the personality of a wet fish. The game was nothing more than a cash grab, and it hurt more than losing the 60 dollars to pay for it.

Disney, this isn't you. The detail and love you pumped into my all time favorite IP belies the fact that you CARE. You aren't looking for a cash grab, you want a quality product. This game will usher in a new generation of gamers, do you really want them all cursing your name? Do you really want them accepting gambling in video games as the norm?

Everything I know about your company has convinced me otherwise, please don't let EA do this to a beloved franchise. You're better than that. You've done such great things, don't let this besmirch your good name. It's not too late to turn it around somehow. I believe in you. If you do something about this, imagine the loyalty and trust you'll gain instantly. This is your chance to enfranchise a multitude and gain more die hard supporters.

Do the right thing,

You've gotta be fucking kidding.

How are you gonna talk about good Star Wars games and disrespect Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy like that? Both made well after Shadows came out.

Let's not forget about Republic Commando, Star Wars Galaxies (Pre-CU of course), or even the arcade game that had the joystick thingy and you piloted vehicles and did lightsaber fights.

Then there was the original Battlefront and BF2. Both fantastic in their own rights.

Even Bioware's SWTOR was a decent game.

I don't think you've played very man Star Wars games if you think every single one since N64 was bad.

Edit: Adding KOTOR to here. I was never a fan of the KOTOR games, but I know people LOVE both of them, so it's fair to include.

There's no microtransactions, no pay walls, no predatory business practices. Just pay once, and play to your heart's content.

Be careful, though. These are all games you will have a hard time putting down. When you pry yourself free and back to Reddit, drop by r/stardewvalley r/factorio and r/slimerancher.

10731,dprqhof,t1_dprne6l,"That's not actually the point and it is actually really vile but also a brilliant strategy. It's basically going off of what we already do as gamers: you are playing a sniper and some asshole on the other team keeps killing you. But every time this player kills you, you see a killcam replay, including what weapon and attachments he used to kill you.

Thus you, a weaker, less experienced player, will probably try a strategy similar to what a more experienced player will use. As a result, you spend money on that $5 sniper rifle that you would otherwise unlock in a month and then spend another $5 getting attachments. All to emulate some guy you fought who kicked your ass.

And then, of course, you get paired with a new player with a different gun. Guess who you want to emulate then?

As a side note, they were also going to use your purchase history and preferred weapon choices to select levels that you would likely do better in. Obviously, a sniper is going to want a wide open map while a guy with an SMG may prefer tightly packed hallways. Then you would be more likely to purchase weapons and equipment to help you perform better.

All in all, it's using psychology and how players already behave as a way to facilitate spending. It's genius from a economic perspective but it's really devious.",/r/gaming/comments/7cog1u/can_we_please_boycott_star_wars_battlefront_2/dprqhof/,GodBlessThisGhetto

10834,dprq56h,t1_dprpx0b,There was an interview with Drew Karpshyrn(sp?) where he talked about where he was going with the overall story and hinted it was going to have to do with the Mass Relays accelerating the effects of Dark Matter/Energy accelerating the Heat Death of the universe and the Reapers were trying to stop that and the harvest cycle was an attempt to figure out how to stop it.,/r/gaming/comments/7cog1u/can_we_please_boycott_star_wars_battlefront_2/dprq56h/,HeavenCats
10835,dprqjyw,t1_dprpx0b,"The Dark Energy ending to Mass Effect revolves around the concept that the vast use and overuse of element zero to fuel space flight and biotics, was speeding up the death of the galaxy/universe. When element zero is introduced to an electrical current, it releases dark energy that allows for the creation of mass effect fields. Propelling ships at FTL speeds and granting biotics with extraordinary powers. But it also has an entropic effect on the universe around it, leading to destabilization and potentially a Big Crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang. 

I‚Äôm not sure if the ME team had fully thought things out before they had to scrap it. But it seems that the Reapers were culling organic races to slow this entropic effect caused by the use of element zero. But allowed organics to flourish for a time in the hopes that a race would eventually come that would be able to stop or reverse the effects dark energy was having on the universe. As the Reapers themselves could not use biotics to reverse it, for some ‚Äútechno- science magic‚Äù reason. 

An example of the first plot threads of this dark energy ending popped up in ME2 on the planet you rescue and recruit Tali from. The sun being destabilized for unknown (dark energy) reasons, barraging the planet with extremely high levels of radiation.

10837,dprqd50,t1_dprpx0b,The original idea was using dark energy (via Biotics) hastened the end of the universe because it increased entropy. Only organics can use dark energy so Reapers always try to stop organics from using it. They realized they can also use dark energy to reverse entropy so they have been harvesting organics to gain more knowledge about it and waiting for the perfect organics that can use it to reverse it. That was the original idea.,/r/gaming/comments/7cog1u/can_we_please_boycott_star_wars_battlefront_2/dprqd50/,eXclurel
10838,dprr80n,t1_dprpx0b,"Dark Matter from all the tech we used would consume the galaxy but no one figured it out. Reapers would reset the galaxy as so it didn't destroy everything and then take the best/brightest of species as a reaper, where they'd travel back into dark space and try and work on a solution. That's why they were building a human reaper at the end of 2.

Adding more of what I gathered. The Promeatheans had figured this out and the device we were building was going to detonate every Relay in the galaxy which would destroy everything. This would cause the Reapers a dilemna, they want to save the galaxy by destroying us but if they didn't leave us alone we were going to blow it up anyway and that would buy us time to figure out the solution ourselves.

10839,dpryk0w,t1_dprpx0b,"So basically in ME2 on Tali's missions you hear a bit about The Star haestrom is orbiting around, apparently it's dying faster than it should be. 

The original ending was based on the reaper cycle being about slowing the heat death of the universe by limiting mass effect drive usage (the cause of the accelerating dark matter/heat death problems). While the reapers found a solution, they kept turning the most intellectually capable species into reapers in order to increase their collective knowledge. So the original ME3 campaign was going to be about whether or not you decide to use the crucible to kill the reapers or let them continue their cycle. Your success in saving people throughout the series directly affects whether or not your capable of solving the dark matter issue. 

Then they scrapped that ending, which is why the whole ""we harvest organics to save them from synthetics"" plot line felt shoehorned out of nowhere. It's also why the three colored decisions had so many plot holes, they didn't have time to hammer it out correctly.",/r/gaming/comments/7cog1u/can_we_please_boycott_star_wars_battlefront_2/dpryk0w/,

fast forward a few years: I had to move to the East Coast. It was a tough decision but I couldn't bring him to a new area with barely any space to roam (35 by 35 lot versus hundreds of acres to roam).

Fast forward a few visits back every year for 3 years. He wasn't getting as much exercise and age was getting to him. I would always ask about him when I phoned my parents. My Mom and Dad were worried about his health so we decided we should make an appointment for him.

I remember flying 3400 kms plus back home to put my dog down. My new gf at the time also flew out after her rotation. We walked with him for a bit. His arthritis was super bad so I moved heavy stuff out of his way and he was just so happy to be walked by us. I spent the day with him, fed him some big chunks of steak and laid with him on his pillow.

The next morning We knelt on the blanket while the needle was used and I feel like he instantly knew what was happening. He was very weak at this time. 11 years 10 months old. He hobbled over and collapsed on my lap looking up at me. I was so happy to be there for him.

Everytime I think about him or about us being in the room when he was put down I cry. I don't regret it though. I think if you are willing to raise a pet you should be there for then at the end. No question.

Looking back the greatest pain was the days and months before she was gone. Like leading up to her death. I spent so much time obsessing over what would happen when she was gone. How would I carry on-all that stuff. I spent so much time worrying about the future and then once it happened‚Äîidk even what to say. It‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt compute. In a way I almost *don‚Äôt* feel grief *because* she‚Äôs gone. Her form isn‚Äôt here for me to actually experience or behold. It‚Äôll never take shape again. I don‚Äôt know if some pressure in the sinuses can capture what I lost. But I guess that‚Äôs the point of crying and grief we have to do *something* when such a horrible thing happens to us. What I‚Äôve l earned is no emotion or memory can substitute experience.

People always say the pain never goes away when they are gone but I‚Äôm not having that experience. I feel like I haven‚Äôt felt *enough* pain since she died.

A couple weeks later he'd been part of the family, and I loved him so much. He was the same age as me, 6 years old. One day we noticed that his right paw was a little larger than his left, so we went to the vet and asked what was up with him. He'd gotten a tumor. It was too big for us to remove, and we really didn't want to put him down (even though it would've been for the better).

Several years went by and I was roughly 12 at this point, but his health was slowly deteriorating. The tumour had grown out to the point where you could visibly see it coming out of him. He didn't know where the litter box was, and he'd started eating his own stool. One day I got home and I remember playing some games and, as always, he was lying down by my side. I remember I heard whimpering. It was horrifying. I remember I just sat there staring at him. I didn't know how to react. His face was sopping wet, absolutely covered in his tears, and mine had been mixed in there as well. I'd like to think that he was happy when it all ended.

11893,i82ym71,t1_i82uamz,"I also have a heartbreaking story, but instead I'll share my favorite.

We had a grey tuxedo cat named Ezra. Besides loving French fries, Ezra was a stealth ninja. She only knocked off the glasses she intended to, and could leap from the floor to the counter to the fridge as if she had wings.

She also loved sleeping on our old CRT TV. Well one day we upgraded to our first LED flat screen. It was amazing how clear and bright the picture was, to the point where the lens flares in the first Abrams Star Trek would cause the TV to switch on and off the auto brightness feature and we were about to return it.

Unfortunately for Ezra we didn't return the TV. And so when she went to jump up to her favorite napping spot, time slowed down. We saw her approach and look up to the top of the television. Our voices raised two octaves too low and our butts lifted off, but to a cat as nimble as Ezra we were but sloths swimming in molasses. She took flight.

As she reached the apex of her jump, she realized her mistake: this new television had no depth. Her feet panicked to adjust but there was but air to land on. In horror known only to Ezra and kids pushed into swimming pools, her eyes became saucers. The television rocked but the Samsung swivel base did it's job admirably. Ezra meanwhile entered extreme scamper mode, and in either one bound or a thousand steps the grey lightning bolt zoomed out stage right.",/r/gaming/comments/umnzo3/how_the_grim_reaper_sends_good_boys_to_the/i82ym71/,casualsax

Between breaks from crying I had the idea to immediately go and upload all the photos I had of him to my laptop and I plan on having them all printed and put into a photo album. You should do the same thing with pictures of your cat so that you have photos reminding you of the times your cat was in good health and able to enjoy an amazing life with you. The love between the two of you is something really special, something that the passing of our physical selves could never undo. Don‚Äôt ever forget the pure joy your cat brought you.

Most importantly, your cat and my dog want us to show the world a little extra love and goodness to the world since their absence might have made it a darker place. Don‚Äôt let their passing result in a slump, but rather a jolt that makes you want to do more and be a better you.

12045,i83yrru,t1_i83qm3p,"I swore to myself I'd be there until the end for my pup - but sometime life (or death) has other plans.....

My dog had been ill with what we thought was a stomach bug, 3 days in he was much better so we thought it was a virus that ran its course - but his appetite was gone.  A couple days later he still barely was eating so we took him in.  Stayed for a couple hours and the vet recommended we go home as they felt it wasn't that serious but they needed to run some tests as they didn't know what was wrong but he was anemic and dehydrated - the tests would take some time so we went home expecting to pick him up later with a prescription or something.  This was around 10am.

At 2pm I got a call from the vet - they suspected a puncture in his intestine and recommended exploratory surgery immediately as they suspected he had turned septic and things were going downhill quickly and they needed to act.

We were rushing to be with our boy when at 2:34 we received the call that they couldn't save him, he was suffering and we needed to end it.  I asked if we could please be there when it happened...the vet said:

""He's asleep now and not in pain; if you were to see him, we'd need to wake him up - which at best he would just be confused and scared and possible in pain as we said our goodbyes - so I recommend, for his sake, we put him down and we do it right now; you won't be able to say goodbye - he will have passed by the time you arrive""

So we told them it was ok, let him go, but please someone be there with him.  I know it was the right thing to do, but we never should have left the vet.  I wasn't there, I let him down right at the end and I don't know that I can ever forgive myself....",/r/gaming/comments/umnzo3/how_the_grim_reaper_sends_good_boys_to_the/i83yrru/,Jpotter145

But she was the only thing I had in my darkest days, I wasn't gonna leave her there alone with a strange person.

Our cat, a fat orange tabby who does not deserve his official name of Leo but definitely deserves his nickname of Goober, has a fixation for bread (and macaroni and cheese, weirdly enough - the cheaper the better!).

One morning, we awoke to find the torn, tattered remnants of a jumbo size English muffin directly in the center of the kitchen floor.  Not only did Goober hop up on the counter, he viciously tore open the plastic bag to seize his prey, haul it down to the floor, and rip it apart.

Now, we need to keep our bread in a metal breadbox and our butter covered under plastic shields, but it's somehow worth it for the fat lovable lard of a cat.

Honestly, a well placed shot would have made everything so much easier for the dog. When deployed, we had a stray that got close to everyone in the unit, but got crushed in a forklift accident. We had no way to put the dog out of its misery, the dog was in so much pain, and his brother pupper was just whining nearby, distressed and confused. My speccy loved the dog, so he got desperate, trying euthanize the dog with a bag, but it just made it all so much worse. This was an overseas training exercise so we obviously don't have live ammunition or access to animal control. We had to beg our unit doc to somehow write-off a crash cart injection to stop the poor dog's heart. It still wasn't comforting, the pupper suffered on his way out, his pupper brother was never the same afterwards. Pretty much everyone was bummed for the rest of the exercise.

12249,drqmavo,t3_7m13gd,"Some history in that it wasn't solely an evangelical thing. Evangelicals have always had a hate-hate relationship with pop culture, but D&D panic became mainstream a little bit due to the general ""Satanic panic"" craze, as well as a specific case with James Dallas Egbert where lawmen incorrectly speculated D & D drove his behavior (a failed suicide attempt.) The old movie Mazes and Monsters is a fictionalized retelling of that case.

The Satanic Panic in general is something that tends to be forgotten now. People believed that there were cabals of satanists around that abused children and did other nasty things, due to a couple trials that heavily relied on the now discredited idea of repressed memories. This was mostly a secular idea. The meme joke ""show me on the doll where he touched you"" came from this, but was used along with leading questions to get vulnerable kids to confess to being abused in utterly bizarre and false ways. It's something that reads like it was straight out of fiction, but it really happened in the 1980s, and D&D was close enough to get hit in the crossfire from it.

It happened mostly as a reaction to the rise of mass media and the pretty harsh amount of social change we saw in the 80s. It's actually scarier that it was forgotten so quickly; if you grew up in that time, the fact that people literally thought it existed, and that it shaped pop culture in not a few ways, has always troubled me. It actually affected Christian fundamentalist belief in that it spawned the ""spiritual warfare"" trope and heightened belief in the existence and power of demons to influence people's behavior. A good example of this is in the novel ""This Present Darkness"" by Frank Peretti, which was my generation's Left Behind. And people actually milked this behavior; the Christian comedian Mike Warnke among others actually claimed to be ex satanists of the moral panic variety.

It's really a cautionary tale of how people act during times of social panic and what can set them off. It's not actually religion alone; religious people opposed the advent of the bar code, for one, and never saw the level of demonization at the secular level we did with D&D. (Though we do have to thank them for really linking bar codes with dehumanization, for example; sometimes religious critique can actually be dead on in emotional tone, while not on facts.) But if secular people on the whole are vulnerable, you get these ideas transmitted widespread.

Just posting this if you think parents forbidding people from playing D&D is solely hyper religious nutcases. A lot of secular people fell for it too, and its too easy to fall into the idea that normal people can't fall prey to moral panic ideas.

Grew up in a Conservative, religious family, and my mother pushed me to try D&D, Warhammer/40k, and my mother was the one who got me to read Harry Potter. The first two I did not get into til after college because I wanted to focus on my studies, but I love playing both. Even into Magic the Gathering and my mother defended me playing it. Played poke'mon too. So to me the stereotype of nerdy stuff hating Christians was weird.

>The high point of the show for my Mom was watching ‚ÄúOf Dice and Men‚Äù the first night.¬† Playing host to dramatic theatre is not, strictly speaking, in the PAX charter.¬† We talked about moving parts on Wednesday, but if you want to talk about some moving-ass¬†parts, a stage performance constitutes an authentic whirligig.¬† It takes some fucking balls to put on a show anywhere, let alone in a converted convention room. ¬†Something special must have happened in there, though, because people wanted to talk about it for the remainder of the show.

>My mother has never entirely understood roleplaying.¬† I don‚Äôt intend to belabor the point, but when I was a young man it was¬†the position of our church¬†that Dungeons & Dragons held within it the clustered seeds of apostasy.¬† She was so bewildered by what she had seen during Of Dice and Men that she made it a point to attend our D&D Live panel, where her son and his friends played this mysterious game on stage.¬† The devil did show up, true, and we did go to hell, just as the clergy had suggested we might.¬† Except in the actual version of events, as has happened so many times, we stood against the King of Lies at the very gates of his damned realm and emerged triumphant.

>My mother came up to me after the panel was over, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jerry.¬† I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù ¬†She wiped the corner of her left eye with her thumb. ¬†‚ÄúThey told me it was something else.‚Äù

I asked my mom for it once. I was promptly told ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs Satanic.‚Äù So I never played until I met my wife in college. 

Now, I‚Äôm a deacon in a very conservative evangelical church. My wife and I attend a weekly D&D game. In fact, I‚Äôd say close to half our members either love playing D&D or would love it if they had the chance to play. I‚Äôm getting ready to start my kids playing soon. 

Also, my mom (who is a member of a different, very conservative fundamentalist church) has mellowed out quite a bit.

The night before the trip to the desert they burned all my D&D books in the hibachi, smashed my dice with a hammer, and made me kneel in the gravel while they prayed over me for a couple of hours.

Fortunately their crazy bullshit resulted in me becoming homeless at 14, and some nice devil-worshiping drug-addicted premarital-sex-having punks took me in. They not only had epic D&D campaigns, they also turned me on to playing Call of Cthulhu. And reading books that didn't have Jesus on the cover. Actually they were responsible for knocking the corners off of my fucking hayseed life until I rounded out into a late-blooming D&D-playing nascent renaissance man.

My mom has even created a character or two. When we think back to all the fun we missed out on because of some over religious windbags and ratings-chasing talk shows we feel so silly.

A friend from kindergarten I'd kept in touch with invited me to my first game of AD&D in 1989, and I was hooked - straight to DM, do not pass go, do not collect 200GP.  I'd always been into fantasy-style stories (absolutely loved the Steve Jackson/Ian Livingstone 'Figthing Fantasy' series of books) but AD&D just blew my mind.

I can't imagine my childhood nor teen years *without* Dungeons & Dragons.  It became an absolutely integral part of my formative years and I would not be who I am today without it - not that I'm a Nobel Prize-worthy 'someone,' rather that the 'someone' I have become looks back fondly on my time poring over charts; experimenting with random dungeon generators and cooking up wild adventures to take my friends on.

If there was anytime in my life I could be trapped in for eternity, it would be that point - the one about 4 hours into a gaming session where everyone is caught in the story and as a DM you've got two options - brings the rules to bear and crush the heroes, or give them a thrilling challenge they can win against the odds (literally, as you start rigging dice rolls).

Absolutely awesome times, best in my life.

Just don't tell my wife - she thinks it was a trip to Kobe in 2007 that featured no dungeons, NOR dragons.  Pfft.",/r/gaming/comments/7m13gd/as_a_teen_in_the_80s_my_conservative_godfearing/drqmeea/,-uzo-

The system, D&D, or any other is just a set of rules and some cool framework ideas to keep things going. But don‚Äôt ever let that get in the way of a cool story and character interactions.

After 5 years of searching for group in small eastern European city I decided to DM for my family (50y parents and sister). I could not even imagine that game will go so smooth and funny for all - no problems with rules, no problems with translation from english.    
First battles were hard due to low hp and 3 PC party (later added myself as cleric) - but after two runs I got knowledge of how to manage enemy HP and Attacks to make game more forgiving (not to die from 4 goblins for example). Half trough Starter set (met Green dragon, he kicked our ass and took all gold mocking us and laughing).

After I had the guys over to the house a number of times to play Mechwarrior, I told them that when we play D&D everything is the same, other than we use a fantasy setting and all that entails. They finally agreed that D&D was not nearly as bad as they thought it was and that the hype was miss placed. 

I already have the game bug planted in my 6 y/o daughter's mind. I just hope she has an urge to pick up the rpg bug. She already attends pen and paper sessions my buddies and I still play.

12946,drqo82k,t3_7m13gd,"Interestingly the entire anti-D&D feelings can be traced to one woman Patrica Pulling. Her teen son committed suicide and she wanted to find out the reason why. In some ways she's a sympathetic figure because most everyone can understand the grief of a mother and wanting to feel a sense of purpose after the loss of your child. In other ways she's quite appalling because her one woman campaign did more to stunt D&D and other similar games than you can imagine (many of the comments in this thread will attest to that).
 
News stations at the time were not savvy at all and things like D&D were a new concept that sounded unusual, so her message took off in a way that would seem unusual today. Some commentators here will mention that ""hardcore"" Christians were the people who were forbidding their children but as a product of the time I can assure that parents who had little religious interest did not allow their children to play just based off the info that this women was incredibly successful in propagating after her son's suicide. In a (probably expected by you the reader) twist of fate, D&D probably had little or nothing to do with her son's death but of course no one can be sure in a case like this.

13044,drqp7au,t3_7m13gd,"Younger generations probably can't fully appreciate this, but for me it hits home hard.

I was really into D&D when I was a teen back in the 80's. I had a ton of books, dice, modules, etc., but because of how the world was about those kinds of things then, my friends and I sort of had to keep things ""underground"". My best friend's dad was was crazy Baptist (didn't seem to have a problem with molesting little girls though), and people finding out you played D&D would essentially end your social life and make you a target - especially in a lower-income neighborhood like mine.

I started playing MTG while in the army in '96, and that sort of filled the gap of not playing D&D, since I had pretty much been disconnected from my geeky D&D friends. It was nice seeing that the world was changing and people were starting to accept fantasy/role-playing games like they were. It wasn't quite as taboo as it used to be.

Skip ahead to about 2010. My oldest daughter, who was as geeky as I was at that age, was starting to get into MTG. By this point, I hadn't played in years, but I bought some cards and we started playing and it became our thing. She later moved on to D&D a little. I really wanted play with her at some point, but our relationship started to change as she was getting older.

Skip ahead again. My daughter took her own life earlier this year at the age of 21. This came after a number of years of a rocky relationship between us. I never had the chance to play D&D with her.

OP's post is so awesome because it reminds me of when we first started playing MTG together. There was a bond created then that I still feel.

I'm so glad that people have, for the most part, moved on from demonizing these kinds of games and see them for the creative releases and social activities that they are.",/r/gaming/comments/7m13gd/as_a_teen_in_the_80s_my_conservative_godfearing/drqp7au/,bigboomstik

When my friends and I first started out, we tried to do *everything* by the rules and it really became an arduous task. 5th edition has trimmed out a good bit, but there's still a lot.

Secondly: Don't over-plan, have a general outline and be ready to take a detour for whatever your players want to do. Players are often difficult to anticipate. Roll with the punches, eventually you'll be experienced and can run an entire session from the top of your head.

Other than that, most things come down to specific examples of what to do. If you're ever unsure, visit us over at /r/dnd!

The rules system for combat and spells is secondary to the core function of the game (for me at least), which is to tell a good story. To do that you need to give the players the ability to genuinely contribute to the plot.

Your daughter is going to come up with ideas that you would never have thought of. She's going to stomp all over major challenges you thought would tax her immensely and then almost get killed by some kobolds. Most of all, she's going to sail past the grand narrative you're trying to tell her and make up her own story instead.

Let her, and help her tell it. If you do that you'll have an amazing time. The easiest way to do this is that when the rules are getting in the way of the story ignore or fudge them.

The Starter Set is a great tool to get into the newest ruleset of D&D.  It has everything you need to get started: premade characters, dice, a quick version of the rules, and an adventure that will last for several sessions.

I use the Starter Set to bring new folks into the hobby all the time and it's an adventure that even experienced players can enjoy.  It has a decent story and a good variety of challenges.

Lots of folks use tools like Discord (myself included) to play D&D and there are even bots that can do everything from roll dice to build characters.  One thing you might consider is playing via a virtual tabletop like Roll20 to play with long distance friends.  Here's a game I recorded of us using it [(Video)](https://youtu.be/a0nGN7bAwFY).

The Chromatics are, generally, evil (that isn't to say there aren't exceptions... if the story/DM demands it). Metallics usually lean towards 'good'. The oft-forgotten Gem Dragons are considered True Neutral. There are also: ""Lung"" Dragons, which are more oriental style dragons (generally benevolent but more forces of nature that don't really interact with mortals all that much, I think); Ferrous dragons, which are ""lawful"" aligned dragons that are iron-alloy based; the Planar Dragons, that exist within certain planes of existence (the most notable of which is the Shadow Dragons); and so on.

That doesn't include the countless takes on Dragons that DMs have made for their own stories or creatures such as Dracoliches.

As a word of warning, I had a DM who went by the rules pretty hard, but I think his biggest downfall was that he had a perception of how a DnD game should be played and pushed it on us as players. Literally the first chapter in the Dungeon Master's Guide talks about different kinds of players and how you can accomodate for them. He unfortunately watched a lot of Matt Colville and used that as justification for what he is doing implicitly with ""that's what the best DMs would do"".

Same goes for any kind of skill or ability.

My parents interrogated me about my religious beliefs because they found out our local Wal-Mart was closed for Christmas and my mom said all business should be closed for Christmas, it should be a law. Rest of the family, sans me, agreed.

I replied that as Christmas is a religious holiday and the government guarantees freedom of religion, or at least it's supposed to, then it would be wrong to force religion on everyone. 

My family questions my beliefs in God and says, well, we should do it anyway. 

My family are the kind that believe we should impose God on everyone, that it should be mandatory law to believe in God, and that anyone who doesn't fit the traditional criteria, such as gays, atheists, and blasphemers, should be killed it at the very least removed from our country and put to some island far away and treated as slaves or something. 

My family has treated me pretty roughly for my questionings, and I've suffered for it. I'm not sure what I believe. But I sure as fuck don't believe it's our place to judge people regardless of what they believe in.

Yes, I'm ok now. A bit scarred, due to that among other reasons. But I'm ok.

Yes, my family is a clear example of /r/RaisedByNarcissists. I've went their a time or two for support.

13586,drqplwl,t1_drqomc0,"Sure. The problem with religions is that it gets indoctrinated into the minds of people by their families at a very susceptible age (usually since birth).

And the claim that the rules/guides come from a deity. Which then in theory you can't contest then, since they are from an all knowing divine/perfect being.

So if there were some people with a dangerous interpretation on those divine guidelines or ""direct godly orders"", then you have a problem.

If these type of families end up being the majority in a society, they could make it dangerous for anyone with different beliefs or lack of them in these locations (towns, states, country).

As they could vote and change laws to align with their liking.

Sure some percentage of their children will not really believe and get out of those heavy chains (like being condemned/cast away from their families, society, etc), but it wouldn't be most.

It is already difficult to make compromises sometimes with people with different and strong earthly interpretations on how a government should be (""the left""/""right""), at least and hopefully most don't think an infallible  divine being tells them how to rule their government.

But I agree with you, most religious people today in the world (in my opinion) aren't as obtuse (especially in the west). It's a trend I hope continues to grow.",/r/gaming/comments/7m13gd/as_a_teen_in_the_80s_my_conservative_godfearing/drqplwl/,pkdrdoom
