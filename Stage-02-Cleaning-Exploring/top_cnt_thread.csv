If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",kaesekarl,"I started digital note-taking in my last year of school. I used a Lenovo Yoga with onenote to write stuff down. I mostly write mathematical stuff so having a pen for these is a no-brainer for me. I gave many people advice on digital note-taking, which device is the best one for them etc, and i boiled it down to a few questions you should ask yourself :

1. Do you ACTUALLY need digital notes? What is the real benefit of making them because it's kind of hyped now and many people just ""do some scetches"" or just ""write that one equation down"", for those it is probably not the best thing to do. Don't forget: Digital note-taking is expensive. Every device which is capable of taking digital notes with a pen is relatively expensive, ipads (especially the pro-line), laptops which can be flipped(like the one i used) or laptop/tablet hybrids (like the surface pro).

2. If you decide it's worth your money, pick a device that fits your needs. If you pretty much only use a pen (and have a ""real computer at hand) get an iPad, the pen is straight up the best in the game. If you also need some power on the go, get something like the yoga, it's a solid laptop with up to 8 cores, 32GB of ram, blablabla, depends on your needs and also if you use this as your only machine or as a secondary device.

3. Maybe a normal laptop is just right for you? If you study something like languages, economics or law, you will be mostly writing texts. So having a good keyboard is a necessity. In that case, a normal laptop would be pretty much all you need. Be honest with yourself and don't just buy something because ""well XY is using this for his studies so it must work for me"".

4. Do you have the skills to actually benefit from the digital world? I know, this sounds harsh because ""of course i have those, i mean this is the modern world and i live inside of it"". But believe it or not, many of my colleagues just don't have the skill set to efficiently take digital notes. Not just copy/paste, but you have to adjust your work flow, keep your data in a useful structure, make backups (seriously, if anyone reads this and doesn't have a backup of his/her notes, make one right now) and many other things like ""how does my colleague get this thing"", what if i want to collab with people etc etc etc... 


Paper with a pen let's you do everything you can imagine, but every application, every device you use is designed by people who are thinking different than you. I got really frustrated while trying to find THE PERFECT App for taking notes until i figured out, not a single app can do everything i want it to.
I still use a good ol' paper-notebook for brainstorming, just because it gives me the opportunity to do exactly what i want, no ""super smooth curves"" or ""super clean images"". Some things are just messy in and of itself, and nothing is better at capturing your thoughts that a piece of paper and a pen.


Maybe this sounds like a rant, i am really not, but maybe this should be a step into seeing the downsides of digital note-taking and not just the beautiful future we want it to be...

If you want some further advice, just pm me, budget, usage are pretty important factors (as i already mentioned) so with more information about your future use case etc maybe i can be a little more helpful",1620671775,3300,615

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",fnnll08,"I finished my first degree by mostly writing on paper. At least during the lectures. I usually wrote a study guide on my laptop but it wasn't perfect. I always wished for a way to make it pretty and efficient by highlighting definitions in boxes or just highlight with a digital highlighter. To be honest I think I would have been happy with paper notes but I always wished for an iPad it was just too expensive I thought.
In my last year I used a surface thinking I would have a laptop that's easy to carry around for writing stuff with a keyboard but I also wanted to take digital handwritten notes. My biggest problem with taking digital hand written notes on the surface was that I was using one note and it just didn't work for me. I've searched ages for an app that would let you annotated PDFs and also let's you put pages ""in between"" because my studying often required answering questions in the scripts. All the apps I found were prescription based and thats's just unnecessary expensive imo. I just hated that I had three binders for math because I wanted to have the questions of the lecture of my homework and of studying separately. With goodnotes you can have these different binders all in one place.

I also want to highlight the functions of digital notes during covid-19. My university requires us to upload our homework or work in teams online. And it's just so much easier to share your screen or send an email with you homework without scanning it first.
Sooo long story short my boyfriend bought an iPad and i used it everytime he didn't. I loved it so much that I bought my own and i regret I didn't do that earlier.",1620673265,1640,302

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",cappucinnoclouds,"I agree with everyone who is saying that it takes time to get used to! I always swore that I would never make the switch. I lugged around my pens, mildliners, and Moleskines in college because I was determined not to go digital. Then I started thinking about grad school and realized that things like books and articles could be exported into Goodnotes and annotated, and I caved. I would never EVER switch back. I love digital notes SO much. 

edit: (I have the iPad Pro)

edit #2 lol I truly never read other poster’s comments before posting my own. I skim them. This is in response to mathematical Lenovo user. 

Firstly, I would be wary of any Microsoft user who is warning you off buying a Mac product. In my experience, it’s 80/20 that they have a strong anti-Mac bias. (I used exclusively Microsoft products pre-2016)

Secondly, I have a Macbook Pro 2016 and an iPad Pro May 2020 model. These are my two primary devices. My use for them will be different from our mathematical friend over at Lenovo. Still, I’ll say this from my own experience—I am shocked just often I reach for my iPad after years of using my Macbook for everything. Now, this will not be your case. The iPad Pro can replace some functions of the Macbook Pro, but even then, it can’t substitute itself for one. However, with a keyboard and a mouse, you’re a hell of a lot more equipped to run the iPad as a “Mobile Oval,” to lovingly quote from “Veep.” It’s your presidential replacement on the go, and from what I understand, even the iPad Air can handle that. (Isn’t the Gen 2 Apple Pencil now compatible with the Air?) 

Secondly.Two, if you’ll take a recommendation from me, ditch the stupid keyboard case and cut straight for the Logitech super slim keyboard. It’s waterproof and weighs very little. I love mine. Get a cheap case from Amazon or something. The keyboard cases are ridiculously overpriced. The Logitech keyboard is something like $70 and holds a charge forever. 

Thirdly, I don’t know what your learning style is, what your major might be, or what else you may want to consider, but digital note-taking is an excellent idea for people with significant reading loads. I was an English education major, and I’ll be attending a master’s program for journalism this fall. I foresaw a hefty reading load. That means I had to lug around several literary anthologies, print out hundreds of short stories etc., etc. It would’ve saved me money to buy the iPad in the first place. 

Fourthly, I do want to point out that you shouldn’t be buying the iPad because of what you see from this trend in digital note-taking. It’s very pretty, and that is definitely why I love it, but it is a considerable expense. I am impulsive by nature. If you are wise, you may want to have someone sit down with you and work out the figures. 

I would say I printed well over 8k pages while in undergrad. That’s for sure lowballing. I know for one class alone, I had to have printed at least a thousand. And that was one single semester. Weigh printer costs against what you would save. I don’t know. Maybe you will break even, and perhaps it’ll be significantly more expensive to buy the iPad. I’m not a math person. 

Fifth, and finally, I think it’s essential that you have something to look forward to going into college. I think it’s worth noting that I use my iPad every single day and have used it almost every day since I purchased it. Now, granted, I did buy it during quarantine, so that’s not a perfect example. However, I do use Goodnotes every day, and I am currently not working and am not attending school until the fall. 

Some highlights:

* I love digital planning now. I was never a consistent planner before, but now I try to plan out my week (or at least jot some things down). I bought my planner from Three65Planners on Etsy, and I highly recommend it. It’s loaded with hyperlinks and templates. 
* Organization. I have severe ADHD, and my organization has always been “throw things anywhere.” Goodnotes’ search feature is fantastic, and I have tons of folders. 
* Color options. I have 150 pen presets, and 48 highlighter presets on Goodnotes. Think about lugging around 150 pens and 48 highlighters, a huge planner, and 70 journals. That would suck. 
* Stickers. Digital stickers are super fun. I have over a thousand digital stickers saved! 


A downside:
* Learning to write on an iPad sucks. I highly recommend getting a palm rejection glove. My handwriting looked like a third-grader when I first got my iPad.",1620673832,4506,802

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",TexasForever_,"From an old response to this question but -

“I would highly recommend it. I got one my second year of college and haven’t looked back. I honestly forget what it’s like to take notes on physical paper. It’s super convenient having all your searchable notes, pdf textbooks, lecture slides, and multiple colored pens and highlighters of all different sizes all in one tiny place. I’ve compared some of my notes since getting my iPad to before and it’s night and day in terms of readability and structure. It’s kind of weird to say but digital note taking makes taking notes “fun”. I could go on forever about all the benefits but there are a few cons.
From my experience, I’ve encountered a very small amount of things that made me say “ugh” since the switch. With everything technology, there will be occasional issues and bugs (e.g. documents disappearing, random spazzes when writing with the Apple Pencil, etc), but these have happened to me maybe a handful of times. Plus, there are plenty of ways to mitigate the damages of these bugs.
I’ve motivated like 4-5 of my friends to switch to digital note taking and they’ve enjoyed the switch. One of my friends has atrocious handwriting and him switching helped him create more readable notes to reference later. Just remember it works for some people better than others. I know people who’d rather take paper notes because the feel and it helps them retain information better. If you have an Apple Store near you or a friend who has an iPad, give it a try. Copy some of your handwritten notes over on the iPad and see what you think. Try to improve them in the process to get a feel of ways it might help make your notes better. Good luck!”",1620681519,1691,303

I don't really get your first point... I know some of my windows/android using friends like really hate apple for... Well everything. I gotta admit, i was one of them a few years back but that has changed.

Today i am a mess when i comes to operating systems:

I use an android phone, the big IPadPro, a windows pc, a windows/linux laptop and a Linux server (like no graphical interface). I still didn't get to like macos very much but that's just because i love to tinker with stuff so having a mac kinda limits me in unnecessary ways (probably there are workarounds n stuff, but i like the way my machine works) plus i also game some time so gaming on a mac was never the best experience... I just use things the way i like to work with them,who knows, maybe soon i will have a macbook because of THE ONE THING, but maybe i won't :D

But i totally get why people use them, don't get me wrong. Especially the new imac models are just *pheew that's hot*... While talking about ""digital note-taking i mostly refer to writing with the apple pencil, after reading my comment again, i kinda mixed things around when talking about that. Digital notes are still digital if you type them, obviously.

Also i wanna thank you for the idea of highlighting in long texts on the ipad, so i would have to optimize my questions:

Do you have a lot of writing to do? Get a good keyboard. (no longer ""do you have to do a lot with long texts"")",1620726646,1455,274

1) get a digital copy of the syllabus for the class (in the course shell, ask instructor, scan it, whatever)

2) put it in keynote, and create blank slide for each topic on the syllabus. hyperlink the syllabus topic to the corresponding slide. 

3) Create a blank slide for any assignment where you feel you will need or be given more information about it at a later date (ex. a research paper would get a slide) and hyperlink it. 

4) create pdf from keynote slides, import it into goodnotes (a worthy $5 investment).

5) in the notebook, click on the topic and proceed to taking notes. you can also import any slides the instructor gives, take pics of slides, etc. right there. 

Good luck!",1620734197,771,137

Two things (which i had to learn the hard way): If you are going to use a bluetooth keyboard with your ipad, make sure to always turn it off before putting it in your bag/backpack! i had to completely reset my ipad because of this. You also should keep backups of the notes on your ipad and in some sort of cloud storage (icloud, google drive, one drive).",1620736494,471,90

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",hahsakhssinak,"It has been by far the most amazing experience for me

I had an iPad since March 2020, I bought the pencil this January 2021 and I thought that “no I need to write on paper so that I don’t lose the habit of writing on paper” (because all my exams for the next four years are subjective three hour long papers where I have to write pages and pages of answers)

And then I got curious and I started using Apple Notes

I organised everything year wise and subject wise (I’m now in the second year)

And I really liked it

I only had to carry this one device to the lecture hall

And I could use split view to read textbook PDFs in iBooks

And then I discovered GoodNotes

Yeah Apple Notes is amazing

But goodnotes just simply blew my mind away

To be honest I don’t really spend on Apps because I think if I don’t use them then I’ll waste the money
(Except Apple Music and Netflix haha)

So then I watched [this](https://youtu.be/83RhJEyzCKc) video that compared Apple Notes to GoodNotes and then I thought why not give it a try

And then I bought it in March 2021

And when I started using it, I couldn’t even imagine all the things this app could do! It can do SO MUCH (some might think that it’s normal, but for me, a newbie, I was, and still am in awe of this app)

Plus my notes are much neater and more enhanced as I can add and delete stuff later on, and also I have endless colours and images and stickers to make them look appealing and functional at the same time

I cannot simply come to terms with the fact that all I have to study is in one device, that is with me wherever I am

And because of this pandemic and how it has affected my country (India), I had to constantly move from my hostel in my medical college to my home and back because of the varying restrictions

And I couldn’t be more than grateful

And of course there is iCloud, so everything is still safe even if something happens to my device (god forbid)

Also there are many video lectures that I watch, so I can just use split view and write away (again, just one device)

So now I have realised the importance of digital note taking

And I can only imagine the stacks of physical notebooks and tons of binders I would’ve collected over the years, trying to search for one small important lecture that a teacher had taken 4 years ago

Okay this is too long, but hey thanks for asking for personal experiences with digital note taking, because I’m honestly proud of myself for doing this🙈

Oh and you can watch [this](https://youtu.be/wW4QcHaeubk) video from Kharma Medic too if you haven’t already!

Air 4 with the 2nd gen Apple Pencil does the job perfectly for me

I bought a used iPad Pro 11"" May 2020 because I was tired of printing 8-15 page assignments/tests to write in the answers, scan them back in, and email to the instructor. He HAD to have hand written answers, would not accept typed. I talked to a tech/nerd friend of mine for help and he suggested iPad Pro with 2nd Gen pen. I was worried about spending the money but oh my goodness I have ZERO regrets. 

In addition to it making college more efficient, it makes my life in general more efficient. 

This is a small list of what I use Goodnotes for daily:   
Planner/Calendar  
Notebooks for life stuff  
Business notes for the business I am starting   
Scans of certificates, etc. essential for my business operations  
I download PDF books from z-lib and read them in GN - then I can highlight, write notes, etc.   
I download my college text books from z-lib (free BTW) and take notes, etc during class.   
PDF instructions for sewing patterns  
Sewing pattern file notes  
I had created a hyperlinked notebook for a surgery I had in 2020 that I was able to export as a PDF to my surgeon   
Scan word search pages into the app for something to do on the go that isn't social media linked LOL 

My daughter has an iPad Air and she was taking notes for a big test in her FFA class and worried she would not have enough information. I had her download GN and showed her how to import pictures, write, change text, etc. and she was able to create an entire sheet of near perfect notes that her teacher allowed her to use in class and he was blown away by it. Even asked if he could have a copy to share with the others. 

The possibilities really are endless. I am currently setting up another iPad for a friend who is a contractor. He lives out of notebooks and sticky notes and it is a complete disaster. So I am setting him up to transition to the digital world to make his life more efficient and his business more professional/productive. 

PS You can pick up a decent iPad Pro 11"" right now on marketplace. My buddy bought a bundle in perfect condition from someone for $600.",1620833236,2164,396

Loved it. For my purposes, I took a lot of engineering courses which are not worth trying to type notes for - plus there were a LOT of diagrams. 


I also have a back/shoulder injury, so I try my best to carry a light load. Currently I teach said engineering courses, so I have an iPad Pro for giving notes and marking up drawings. I can share my screen and it's much more comfortable for me than writing on a whiteboard for long periods of time. I also refuse to accept hard copy drawing submissions for my drafting courses. It's much easier to mark them up in a pdf and send them back to my students, and it prevents me from carrying 100 11x17 drawing packages (and saves my students $$$).


I like being able to move things around, and create space for additional ideas that fit in with something I've written previously. Goodnotes is great for all of the folder options, and I like the fading pointer feature when I'm going over a PowerPoint. Personally, I wouldn't go back to school without it.",1621092152,1063,196
