      "I switched to digital notes during my second year of college and as such have six semesters and three years of experience with them, and I can say I GREATLY prefer them over physical notes.  The ability to search for things in-text but still have the option to draw diagrams makes them very useful.  I also like them for future reference, because I have all of the notebooks from my last three years in college and none of them from my first two, and I can access them both on my iPad and any other device which can access Google Drive.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That certainly sounds convenient. Knowing me, I’m Prly gonna end up buying the iPad, I just wanna hear stories from other people about this\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love it! It takes some time to getting used to, the writing feeling especially, but it's very practical. You can access your notes from literally anywhere if you Auto synch them as a pdf (as well with/instead of via iCloud, I do both) so if you just want to look something up but don't have your iPad with you, your notes are on your Cloud. It also saves so much paper. My brother, who is also doing online school but doesn't take notes digitally, has to print out sooo much and I can just import it and write on the iPad. Also being able to search your notes is so practical\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like it and spend so much time on my iPad I'd say it's a must have for me\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I switched over to writing my notes on a ipad earlier this year. I was initially concerned whether or not I'll like it but so far it's working fantastically for me. I can't recommend it enough\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I bought an iPad Air a couple months back to take my work notes digital and I only wish I did it sooner. My work recently became very note intensive and I’ve gone through umpteen notepads since lockdown began and having to rifle back to find old notes was becoming unmanageable. With GoodNotes you can search your handwritten notes which is awesome!\n",

      "Such an amazing feeling with an Apple Pencil and a matte screen protector.\n",

      "100% go for it. You won’t regret it\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Honestly having an iPad for college completely changed my college experience. I switched to an iPad for notetaking my third semester in college after killing so many trees printing out powerpoint after powerpoint to take notes on. The iPad completely changed this: no more hauling around notebooks and binders, no more losing pencils and refilling ink in pens... it’s just awesome. As a perfectionist but also someone who loves writing in pen, I would constantly be stressed out in fear of messing up my notes and having to scratch out work on paper. On the iPad, you can just undo it and forget it ever happened! I’d highly recommend the iPad Air for notetaking and choosing Goodnotes :)\n",

      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I started digital note-taking in my last year of school. I used a Lenovo Yoga with onenote to write stuff down. I mostly write mathematical stuff so having a pen for these is a no-brainer for me. I gave many people advice on digital note-taking, which device is the best one for them etc, and i boiled it down to a few questions you should ask yourself :\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Do you ACTUALLY need digital notes? What is the real benefit of making them because it's kind of hyped now and many people just \"do some scetches\" or just \"write that one equation down\", for those it is probably not the best thing to do. Don't forget: Digital note-taking is expensive. Every device which is capable of taking digital notes with a pen is relatively expensive, ipads (especially the pro-line), laptops which can be flipped(like the one i used) or laptop/tablet hybrids (like the surface pro).\n",

      "2. If you decide it's worth your money, pick a device that fits your needs. If you pretty much only use a pen (and have a \"real computer at hand) get an iPad, the pen is straight up the best in the game. If you also need some power on the go, get something like the yoga, it's a solid laptop with up to 8 cores, 32GB of ram, blablabla, depends on your needs and also if you use this as your only machine or as a secondary device.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Maybe a normal laptop is just right for you? If you study something like languages, economics or law, you will be mostly writing texts. So having a good keyboard is a necessity. In that case, a normal laptop would be pretty much all you need. Be honest with yourself and don't just buy something because \"well XY is using this for his studies so it must work for me\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Do you have the skills to actually benefit from the digital world? I know, this sounds harsh because \"of course i have those, i mean this is the modern world and i live inside of it\". But believe it or not, many of my colleagues just don't have the skill set to efficiently take digital notes. Not just copy/paste, but you have to adjust your work flow, keep your data in a useful structure, make backups (seriously, if anyone reads this and doesn't have a backup of his/her notes, make one right now) and many other things like \"how does my colleague get this thing\", what if i want to collab with people etc etc etc... \n",

      "Paper with a pen let's you do everything you can imagine, but every application, every device you use is designed by people who are thinking different than you. I got really frustrated while trying to find THE PERFECT App for taking notes until i figured out, not a single app can do everything i want it to.\n",
      "I still use a good ol' paper-notebook for brainstorming, just because it gives me the opportunity to do exactly what i want, no \"super smooth curves\" or \"super clean images\".

      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I finished my first degree by mostly writing on paper. At least during the lectures. I usually wrote a study guide on my laptop but it wasn't perfect. I always wished for a way to make it pretty and efficient by highlighting definitions in boxes or just highlight with a digital highlighter. To be honest I think I would have been happy with paper notes but I always wished for an iPad it was just too expensive I thought.\n",
      "In my last year I used a surface thinking I would have a laptop that's easy to carry around for writing stuff with a keyboard but I also wanted to take digital handwritten notes. My biggest problem with taking digital hand written notes on the surface was that I was using one note and it just didn't work for me. I've searched ages for an app that would let you annotated PDFs and also let's you put pages \"in between\" because my studying often required answering questions in the scripts. All the apps I found were prescription based and thats's just unnecessary expensive imo. I just hated that I had three binders for math because I wanted to have the questions of the lecture of my homework and of studying separately. With goodnotes you can have these different binders all in one place.\n",
      "\n",

      "I agree with everyone who is saying that it takes time to get used to! I always swore that I would never make the switch. I lugged around my pens, mildliners, and Moleskines in college because I was determined not to go digital. Then I started thinking about grad school and realized that things like books and articles could be exported into Goodnotes and annotated, and I caved. I would never EVER switch back. I love digital notes SO much. \n",
      "\n",
      "edit: (I have the iPad Pro)\n",
      "\n",
      "edit #2 lol I truly never read other poster’s comments before posting my own. I skim them. This is in response to mathematical Lenovo user. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, I would be wary of any Microsoft user who is warning you off buying a Mac product. In my experience, it’s 80/20 that they have a strong anti-Mac bias. (I used exclusively Microsoft products pre-2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I have a Macbook Pro 2016 and an iPad Pro May 2020 model. These are my two primary devices. My use for them will be different from our mathematical friend over at Lenovo. Still, I’ll say this from my own experience—I am shocked just often I reach for my iPad after years of using my Macbook for everything. Now, this will not be your case. The iPad Pro can replace some functions of the Macbook Pro, but even then, it can’t substitute itself for one. However, with a keyboard and a mouse, you’re a hell of a lot more equipped to run the iPad as a “Mobile Oval,” to lovingly quote from “Veep.” It’s your presidential replacement on the go, and from what I understand, even the iPad Air can handle that. (Isn’t the Gen 2 Apple Pencil now compatible with the Air?) \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly.Two, if you’ll take a recommendation from me, ditch the stupid keyboard case and cut straight for the Logitech super slim keyboard. It’s waterproof and weighs very little. I love mine. Get a cheap case from Amazon or something. The keyboard cases are ridiculously overpriced. The Logitech keyboard is something like $70 and holds a charge forever. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, I don’t know what your learning style is, what your major might be, or what else you may want to consider, but digital note-taking is an excellent idea for people with significant reading loads. I was an English education major, and I’ll be attending a master’s program for journalism this fall. I foresaw a hefty reading load. That means I had to lug around several literary anthologies, print out hundreds of short stories etc., etc. It would’ve saved me money to buy the iPad in the first place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourthly, I do want to point out that you shouldn’t be buying the iPad because of what you see from this trend in digital note-taking. It’s very pretty, and that is definitely why I love it, but it is a considerable expense. I am impulsive by nature. If you are wise, you may want to have someone sit down with you and work out the figures. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would say I printed well over 8k pages while in undergrad. That’s for sure lowballing. I know for one class alone, I had to have printed at least a thousand. And that was one single semester. Weigh printer costs against what you would save. I don’t know. Maybe you will break even, and perhaps it’ll be significantly more expensive to buy the iPad. I’m not a math person. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, and finally, I think it’s essential that you have something to look forward to going into college. I think it’s worth noting that I use my iPad every single day and have used it almost every day since I purchased it. Now, granted, I did buy it during quarantine, so that’s not a perfect example. However, I do use Goodnotes every day, and I am currently not working and am not attending school until the fall. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some highlights:\n",
      "\n",
      "* I love digital planning now. I was never a consistent planner before, but now I try to plan out my week (or at least jot some things down). I bought my planner from Three65Planners on Etsy, and I highly recommend it. It’s loaded with hyperlinks and templates. \n",
      "* Organization. I have severe ADHD, and my organization has always been “throw things anywhere.” Goodnotes’ search feature is fantastic, and I have tons of folders. \n",
      "* Color options. I have 150 pen presets, and 48 highlighter presets on Goodnotes. Think about lugging around 150 pens and 48 highlighters, a huge planner, and 70 journals. That would suck. \n",
      "* Stickers. Digital stickers are super fun. I have over a thousand digital stickers saved! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A downside:\n",
      "* Learning to write on an iPad sucks. I highly recommend getting a palm rejection glove. My handwriting looked like a third-grader when I first got my iPad.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes go for it, personally it completely changed the game and my grades have improved vastly. I have the ipad 7th gen and the first apple pencil, i also have a keyboard case from amazon i use if i need it but i mainly write everything down. I like goodnotes because i am able to access my notes &amp; digital textbooks on my phone and on my laptop through google drive.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "From an old response to this question but -\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would highly recommend it. I got one my second year of college and haven’t looked back. I honestly forget what it’s like to take notes on physical paper. It’s super convenient having all your searchable notes, pdf textbooks, lecture slides, and multiple colored pens and highlighters of all different sizes all in one tiny place. I’ve compared some of my notes since getting my iPad to before and it’s night and day in terms of readability and structure. It’s kind of weird to say but digital note taking makes taking notes “fun”. I could go on forever about all the benefits but there are a few cons.\n",
      "From my experience, I’ve encountered a very small amount of things that made me say “ugh” since the switch. With everything technology, there will be occasional issues and bugs (e.g. documents disappearing, random spazzes when writing with the Apple Pencil, etc), but these have happened to me maybe a handful of times. Plus, there are plenty of ways to mitigate the damages of these bugs.\n",
      "I’ve motivated like 4-5 of my friends to switch to digital note taking and they’ve enjoyed the switch. One of my friends has atrocious handwriting and him switching helped him create more readable notes to reference later. Just remember it works for some people better than others. I know people who’d rather take paper notes because the feel and it helps them retain information better. If you have an Apple Store near you or a friend who has an iPad, give it a try. Copy some of your handwritten notes over on the iPad and see what you think. Try to improve them in the process to get a feel of ways it might help make your notes better. Good luck!”\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You'll definitely get biased opinions in this subreddit, but I agree with what others have said here! Some of the features like OCR for searching handwriting and ease of annotating preexisting documents are just irreplaceable.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I wonder what percentage of school notes look like what ends up posted here for our neatness gratification. I for one cannot make anything look really attractive unless I have the ability to spend time doing and redoing which I cannot imagine you'd have in a lecture or seminar setting taking notes from a live speaker. Redoing them is of course an option, so if you're ok doing that and in split screen and are confident you'd be hitting the goals you have in mind...\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I did digital through grad school, granted it was on an HP that had pen capabilities. Scanned my books in on my all in one. Years later, have my notes and things anywhere I go. Love.\n",

It’s so convenient to have all your notes and school-related documents in one place while also not having to worry about printing, organizing, and bringing them everywhere.

      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",

Best part is that we can integrate images with the notes and annotate it.\n",

      "I only got the iPad for digital notes in my 4th year of university and honestly I’m so mad I didn’t do this earlier!! It’s saved so much time with organising notes and makes it easier to study because you don’t see the massive pile of notes and papers on your desk. I initially was worried about missing paper and stationary and all that but taking notes on the iPad and reading is so much more convenient especially if you like to study in libraries or coffee shops. You can also make them really pretty and nice if you enjoy that. It will save you so much time especially because in university the information they give you is just all over the place and they love giving lots of slides and handouts so I definitely recommend using an iPad to make it more convenient and easy. Hope I’ve helped a bit let me know if you have questions I love speaking about iPads hahah :))\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Also I forgot to mention, it depends on what course you’re studying so it might be useful for you if you need to learn lots of things or write stuff out a ton. However, if you’re taking a course where it’s mostly writing ideas and essays and things like that, an iPad may not be as useful to you. So it might be worth doing a semester without an iPad and then seeing how you feel around December time?\n",

      "If the notes are just for me, they're usually barely legible at first. I kind of do this on purpose - I want to redo them later. It helps me be more concise in my notes, and it's an opportunity for review.\n",

      "YES!!! THE BEST IDEA EVER! I am a high school stud and I absolutely loooove my ipad. I have an ipad mini bc I think that the model of the ipad fits in my bag perfectly but the air is also a great option. Goodnotes has been my best friend!\n",
